The Samba-Team is pleased to announce the final production release of
Samba-1.9.17p5.

Please note that this release is bein made purely for those who like
the comfort of knowing that the code is stable and has been in use for
a significant period. We ALL know that the next product is always
__BETTER__, just like we know that it will without doubt have some
not quite expected features too. The Samba-Team listens to it's users.
You want stability, reliability and you want us to keep rolling out new
features, improved ease of use, and so on.

Samba-1.9.18 is now in final beta testing and unless any major bugs are
reported within the next two weeks will ship early in 1998. We regret the
delay but we also know that the new features were worth waiting for.

This release of Samba-1.9.17p5 integrates all fixes that have been made to
the Samba-1.9.17 source code tree and that have been included in Samba-1.9.18.
This release is for use in mission critical sites that do NOT like to
be early adopters.

There are several key fixes in this update release:
	- When Samba won the role of master browser it would NOT give it up
	- Added feature of "remote browse sync" which helps those sites
	  that have multi-workgroup / multi-segmented networks.
	- Some minor file-name handling fixes

Should any problems be experienced with this release please mail your bug
report to: samba-bugs@samba.anu.edu.au with the subject: BUGS17P5: XXXXXX

As always, functionality afforded by Samba is for your pleasure, the bugs
(we know there MUST be some) are our responsibility - so please report them
to samba-bugs@samba.anu.edu.au

Seasons Greetings.
The Samba-Team
