; Configuration Options ***** Watch location in smb.conf for side-effects *****
;   include = /etc/smb.conf.%m  ; Where %m is any SMBName (machine name)

; Performance Related Options
   socket options = TCP_NODELAY  ; Read the smb.conf man page!!
;   socket address = aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd  ; Used to specify which socket Samba
                                     ; will listen on (good for aliased systems)
;   keep alive = 60  ; Use only if really needed!!!!

; Domain Control Options
;   domain master = yes  ; specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser
;   domain controller = <NT-Domain-Controller-SMBName>  ; Use with care
; only if you have an NT server on your network that has been configured
; at install time to be a primary domain controller.

; A publicly accessible directory, read/write to all users. Note that all files
; created in the directory by users will be owned by the default user, so
; any user with access can delete any other user's files. Obviously this
; directory must be writable by the default user. Another user could of course
; be specified, in which case all files would be owned by that user instead.

; The following two entries demonstrate how to share a directory so that two
; users can place files there that will be owned by the specific users. In this
; setup, the directory should be writable by both users and should have the
; sticky bit set on it to prevent abuse. Obviously this could be extended to
; as many users as required.
