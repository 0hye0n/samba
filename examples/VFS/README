README for Samba Virtual File System (VFS) Examples
===================================================

This directory contains some sample code to demonstrate VFS
construction.  The following VFS modules are given:

	skel
		A skeleton VFS module.  When used, this module simply
		passes all requests back to the disk functions (i.e it
		operates as a passthrough filter).  It should be
		useful as a starting point for developing new VFS
		modules. 

	audit
		A simple module to audit file access to the syslog
		facility.  The following operations are logged: share
		connect/disconnect, directory opens/create/remove,
		file open/close/rename/unlink/chmod.

	streamer
		Stream file writes to a network address instead of to
		disk.

	perlfs
		A wrapper for writing Samba VFS modules in Perl.

The modules need only to be compiled with -I/samba/source/dir added to
CFLAGS.

Further documentation on writing VFS modules for Samba can be found in
docs directory of the Samba source distribution.
