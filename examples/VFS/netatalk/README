There is the new netatalk module both for HEAD.
This one has some difference from previous module:

-- it doesn't care about creating of .AppleDouble forks, just keeps ones in
sync;

-- if share in smb.conf doesn't contain .AppleDouble item in hide or veto 
list, it will be added automatically.

To my way of thinking, module became more lightweight and speedy.

How to compile: 

you should place proper netatalk.c into examples/VFS/ then run 'configure'
from source/ and then run 'make' from examples/VFS/.

add string 'vfs object = <path_to_netatalk_so>/netatlk.so' to smb.conf. It may
be defined either as global or as share-specific parameter.
