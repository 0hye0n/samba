--
This module requires libxml2 to be installed.

The usage of pdb_xml is pretty straightforward. To export data, use:

pdbedit -e plugin:/usr/lib/samba/pdb_xml.so:filename

(where filename is the name of the file to put the data in)
To import data, use:

pdbedit -i plugin:/usr/lib/samba/pdb_xml.so:filename -e <current-pdb>

Where filename is the name to read the data from and <current-pdb> to put it in.
