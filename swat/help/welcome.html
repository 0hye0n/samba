Welcome to SWAT!<p>

This is a online demonstration of the current version of the Samba Web
Administration Tool. This tool is still being written so you'll find
it looks very rough at this stage.<p>

Normally this opening page would contain the (as yet unwritten) welcome
blurb for SWAT, giving basic instructions on how to use it. I've put
this bit of waffle in its place for the moment. <p>

Also note that SWAT normally demands authentication before showing you
this page, otherwise anyone could modify your smb.conf! I've disabled
that for this demo.<p>

<H2>Features</H2>

Here are some of the features we want to eventually incorporate.<p>

<ul>
<li> manage smbpasswd (add/delete users, change passwords etc)
<li> be able to run the disgnosis steps from DIAGNOSIS.txt
<li> wizard style config building
</ul>

There are also some obvious flaws with what has already been done:

<ul>
<li> help is ghastly
<li> ordering of parameters needs to be looked at
<li> images need redoing
</ul>

On the positive side, here are some good features of SWAT:

<ul>
<li> built in mini web server so you don't need a web server installed to
manage a Samba server, you just need a browser
<li> links to loadparm.c so it automatically makes available new
parameters as they are added to Samba.
<li> it's quite small (around 500 lines of code currently) 
<li> layout and dialog building is done automatically based on the type 
fields in loadparm.c
</ul>


<H2>Installation</H2>

Before you install SWAT you need to realise that it is still work in
progress. It does work but don't be totally surprised if you hit
problems. Also make sure you are prepared to give us some feedback.<p>

If you still want to install it then you will need to fetch the latest
version of Samba via anonymous CVS. See <A
HREF="http://samba.anu.edu.au/cvs.html">http://samba.anu.edu.au/cvs.html</A>. Then
build and install Samba as usual and read the swat/README file that
comes with the source.
