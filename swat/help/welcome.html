Welcome to SWAT!<p>

This is the first release of the Samba Web Administration Tool. This tool 
is being improved so you may find some things look rough at this stage.<p>

SWAT demands authentication before showing you this page, so that only 
authenticated users can modify your smb.conf!<p>

Here are some features of SWAT:

<ul>
<li> Built in mini web server so you don't need a web server installed to
manage a Samba server, you just need a browser.
<li> Linked into the master source code so it automatically makes available new
parameters as they are added to Samba.
<li> Direct links to the html version of the smb.conf man page for help
on parameters.
<li> Layout and dialog building is done automatically based on the type 
of the smb.conf parameter being changed.
<li> Password and account management built in.
</ul>


<H2>Features</H2>

Here are some of the features we want to eventually incorporate.<p>

<ul>
<li> Secure authentication.
<li> Running the disgnosis steps from DIAGNOSIS.txt.
<li> GUI wizard style config building.
</ul>

<H2>Feedback</H2>
