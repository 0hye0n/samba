SWAT Parameters help<p>

We need to reformat the smb.conf man page as HTML with a label for
each parameter. Anyone want to write a perl script? Currently I've
just done a quick hack with an emacs macro to get something in
place. Or maybe the SGML conversion will be the way to go?<p>

<hr>

<a name="admin users">
<H3>admin users (S)</H3><p>

This is a list of users who will be granted administrative privileges
on the share. This means that they will do all file operations as the
super-user (root).<p>

You should use this option very carefully, as any user in this list
will be able to do anything they like on the share, irrespective of
file permissions.<p>

.B Default:
	no admin users<p>

.B Example:
	admin users = jason<p>

<a name="announce as">
<H3>announce as (G)</H3><p>

This specifies what type of server nmbd will announce itself as in
browse lists. By default this is set to Windows NT. The valid options
are "NT", "Win95" or "WfW" meaining Windows NT, Windows 95 and
Windows for Workgroups respectively. Do not change this parameter
unless you have a specific need to stop Samba appearing as an NT
server as this may prevent Samba servers from participating as
browser servers correctly.<p>

.B Default:
    announce as = NT<p>

.B Example
    announce as = Win95<p>

<a name="announce version">
<H3>announce version (G)</H3><p>

This specifies the major and minor version numbers that nmbd
will use when announcing itself as a server. The default is 4.2.
Do not change this parameter unless you have a specific need to
set a Samba server to be a downlevel server.<p>

.B Default:
   announce version = 4.2<p>

.B Example:
   announce version = 2.0<p>

<a name="auto services">
<H3>auto services (G)</H3>
This is a list of services that you want to be automatically added to
the browse lists. This is most useful for homes and printers services
that would otherwise not be visible.<p>

Note that if you just want all printers in your printcap file loaded
then the "load printers" option is easier.<p>

.B Default:
	no auto services<p>

.B Example:
	auto services = fred lp colorlp<p>

<a name="allow hosts">
<H3>allow hosts (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'hosts allow'.<p>

This parameter is a comma delimited set of hosts which are permitted to access
a service. <p>

If specified in the [global] section then it will apply to all
services, regardless of whether the individual service has a different
setting. <p>

You can specify the hosts by name or IP number. For example, you could
restrict access to only the hosts on a Class C subnet with something like
"allow hosts = 150.203.5.". The full syntax of the list is described in
the man page
.BR hosts_access (5).<p>

You can also specify hosts by network/netmask pairs and by netgroup
names if your system supports netgroups. The EXCEPT keyword can also
be used to limit a wildcard list. The following examples may provide
some help:<p>

Example 1: allow all IPs in 150.203.*.* except one<p>

	hosts allow = 150.203. EXCEPT 150.203.6.66<p>

Example 2: allow hosts that match the given network/netmask<p>

	hosts allow = 150.203.15.0/255.255.255.0<p>

Example 3: allow a couple of hosts<p>

	hosts allow = lapland, arvidsjaur<p>

Example 4: allow only hosts in netgroup "foonet" or localhost, but 
deny access from one particular host<p>

 	hosts allow = @foonet, localhost
 	hosts deny = pirate<p>

Note that access still requires suitable user-level passwords.<p>

See
.BR testparm (1)
for a way of testing your host access to see if it
does what you expect.<p>

.B Default:
 	none (i.e., all hosts permitted access)<p>

.B Example:
 	allow hosts = 150.203.5. myhost.mynet.edu.au<p>

<a name="alternate permissions">
<H3>alternate permissions (S)</H3><p>

This option affects the way the "read only" DOS attribute is produced
for UNIX files. If this is false then the read only bit is set for
files on writeable shares which the user cannot write to.<p>

If this is true then it is set for files whos user write bit is not set.<p>

The latter behaviour is useful for when users copy files from each
others directories, and use a file manager that preserves
permissions. Without this option they may get annoyed as all copied
files will have the "read only" bit set.<p>

.B Default:
	alternate permissions = no<p>

.B Example:
	alternate permissions = yes<p>

<a name="available">
<H3>available (S)</H3>
This parameter lets you 'turn off' a service. If 'available = no', then
ALL attempts to connect to the service will fail. Such failures are logged.<p>

.B Default:
 	available = yes<p>

.B Example:
 	available = no<p>

<a name="bind interfaces only">
<H3>bind interfaces only (G)</H3>
This global parameter (new for 1.9.18) allows the Samba admin to limit
what interfaces on a machine will serve smb requests. If affects file service
(smbd) and name service (nmbd) in slightly different ways.<p>

For name service it causes nmbd to bind to ports 137 and 138 on
the interfaces listed in the 'interfaces' parameter. nmbd also binds
to the 'all addresses' interface (0.0.0.0) on ports 137 and 138
for the purposes of reading broadcast messages. If this option is
not set then nmbd will service name requests on all of these
sockets. If "bind interfaces only" is set then nmbd will check
the source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast
sockets and discard any that don't match the broadcast addresses
of the interfaces in the 'interfaces' parameter list. As unicast
packets are received on the other sockets it allows nmbd to
refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive
through any interfaces not listed in the 'interfaces' list.
IP Source address spoofing does defeat this simple check, however
so it must not be used seriously as a security feature for nmbd.<p>

For file service it causes smbd to bind only to the interface
list given in the 'interfaces' parameter. This restricts the
networks that smbd will serve to packets coming in those interfaces.
Note that you should not use this parameter for machines that
are serving ppp or other intermittant or non-broadcast network
interfaces as it will not cope with non-permanent interfaces.<p>

.B Default:
       bind interfaces only = False<p>

.B Example:
       bind interfaces only = True<p>

<a name="browseable">
<H3>browseable (S)</H3>
This controls whether this share is seen in the list of available
shares in a net view and in the browse list.<p>

.B Default:
	browseable = Yes<p>

.B Example: 
	browseable = No
<a name="browse lis">
<H3>browse list(G)</H3>
This controls whether the smbd will serve a browse list to a client
doing a NetServerEnum call. Normally set to true. You should never
need to change this.<p>

.B Default:
	browse list = Yes<p>

<a name="case sensitive">
<H3>case sensitive (G)</H3>
See the discussion on NAME MANGLING.<p>

<a name="case sig names">
<H3>case sig names (G)</H3>
See "case sensitive"<p>

<a name="character set">
<H3>character set (G)</H3>
This allows a smbd to map incoming characters from a DOS 850 Code page
to either a Western European (ISO8859-1) or Easter European (ISO8859-2)
code page. Normally not set, meaning no filename translation is done.<p>

.B Default<p>

	character set =<p>

.B Example<p>

	character set = iso8859-1<p>

<a name="client code page">
<H3>client code page (G)</H3>
Currently (Samba 1.9.17 and above) this may be set to one of two
values, 850 or 437. It specifies the base DOS code page that the
clients accessing Samba are using. To determine this, open a DOS
command prompt and type the command "chcp". This will output the
code page. The default for USA MS-DOS, Windows 95, and Windows NT
releases is code page 437. The default for western european 
releases of the above operating systems is code page 850.<p>

This parameter co-operates with the "valid chars" parameter in
determining what characters are valid in filenames and how
capitalization is done. It has been added as a convenience for
clients whose code page is either 437 or 850 so a convoluted
"valid chars" string does not have to be determined. If you
set both this parameter and the "valid chars" parameter the 
"client code page" parameter MUST be set before the "valid chars"
in the smb.conf file. The "valid chars" string will then augment
the character settings in the "client code page" parameter.<p>

If "client code page" is set to a value other than 850 or 437
it will default to 850.<p>

See also : "valid chars".<p>

.B Default<p>

	client code page = 850<p>

.B Example<p>

	client code page = 437<p>

<a name="comment">
<H3>comment (S)</H3>
This is a text field that is seen next to a share when a client does a
net view to list what shares are available.<p>

If you want to set the string that is displayed next to the machine
name then see the server string command.<p>

.B Default:
	No comment string<p>

.B Example:
	comment = Fred's Files<p>

<a name="config file">
<H3>config file (G)</H3><p>

This allows you to override the config file to use, instead of the
default (usually smb.conf). There is a chicken and egg problem here as
this option is set in the config file! <p>

For this reason, if the name of the config file has changed when the
parameters are loaded then it will reload them from the new config
file.<p>

This option takes the usual substitutions, which can be very useful.<p>

If the config file doesn't exist then it won't be loaded (allowing
you to special case the config files of just a few clients).<p>

.B Example:
	config file = /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf.%m<p>

<a name="copy">
<H3>copy (S)</H3>
This parameter allows you to 'clone' service entries. The specified
service is simply duplicated under the current service's name. Any 
parameters specified in the current section will override those in the
section being copied.<p>

This feature lets you set up a 'template' service and create similar 
services easily. Note that the service being copied must occur earlier 
in the configuration file than the service doing the copying.<p>

.B Default:
 	none<p>

.B Example:
 	copy = otherservice
<a name="create mask">
<H3>create mask (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'create mode'.<p>

When a file is created, the neccessary permissions are calculated
according to the mapping from DOS modes to UNIX permissions, and
the resulting UNIX mode is then bit-wise 'AND'ed with this parameter.
This parameter may be thought of as a bit-wise MASK for the UNIX
modes of a file. Any bit *not* set here will be removed from the
modes set on a file when it is created.<p>

The default value of this parameter removes the 'group' and 'other' 
write and execute bits from the UNIX modes.<p>

Following this Samba will bit-wise 'OR' the UNIX mode created from
this parameter with the value of the "force create mode" parameter 
which is set to 000 by default.<p>

For Samba 1.9.17 and above this parameter no longer affects directory
modes. See the parameter 'directory mode' for details.<p>

See also the "force create mode" parameter for forcing particular
mode bits to be set on created files.
See also the "directory mode" parameter for masking mode bits on created
directories.<p>

.B Default:
 	create mask = 0744<p>

.B Example:
 	create mask = 0775
<a name="create mode">
<H3>create mode (S)</H3>
See
.B create mask.<p>

<a name="dead time">
<H3>dead time (G)</H3>
The value of the parameter (a decimal integer) represents the number of
minutes of inactivity before a connection is considered dead, and it
is disconnected. The deadtime only takes effect if the number of open files
is zero.<p>

This is useful to stop a server's resources being exhausted by a large
number of inactive connections.<p>

Most clients have an auto-reconnect feature when a connection is broken so
in most cases this parameter should be transparent to users.<p>

Using this parameter with a timeout of a few minutes is recommended
for most systems.<p>

A deadtime of zero indicates that no auto-disconnection should be performed.<p>

.B Default:
 	dead time = 0<p>

.B Example:
 	dead time = 15
<a name="debug level">
<H3>debug level (G)</H3>
The value of the parameter (an integer) allows the debug level
(logging level) to be specified in the
.B smb.conf
file. This is to give
greater flexibility in the configuration of the system.<p>

The default will be the debug level specified on the command line.<p>

.B Example:
 	debug level = 3
<a name="default">
<H3>default (G)</H3>
See
.B default service.
<a name="default case">
<H3>default case (S)</H3><p>

See the section on "NAME MANGLING" Also note the addition of "short
preserve case"<p>

<a name="default service">
<H3>default service (G)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'default'.<p>

This parameter specifies the name of a service which will be connected to
if the service actually requested cannot be found. Note that the square
brackets are NOT given in the parameter value (see example below).<p>

There is no default value for this parameter. If this parameter is not given,
attempting to connect to a nonexistent service results in an error.<p>

Typically the default service would be a public, read-only service.<p>

Also note that as of 1.9.14 the apparent service name will be changed to
equal that of the requested service, this is very useful as it allows
you to use macros like %S to make a wildcard service.<p>

Note also that any _ characters in the name of the service used in the
default service will get mapped to a /. This allows for interesting
things.<p>


.B Example:
 	default service = pub
        
        [pub]
             path = /%S
          <p>

<a name="delete readonly">
<H3>delete readonly (S)</H3>
This parameter allows readonly files to be deleted.  This is not normal DOS
semantics, but is allowed by UNIX.<p>

This option may be useful for running applications such as rcs, where UNIX
file ownership prevents changing file permissions, and DOS semantics prevent
deletion of a read only file.<p>

.B Default:
 	delete readonly = No<p>

.B Example:
 	delete readonly = Yes
<a name="deny hosts">
<H3>deny hosts (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'hosts deny'.<p>

The opposite of 'allow hosts' - hosts listed here are NOT permitted
access to services unless the specific services have their own lists to
override this one. Where the lists conflict, the 'allow' list takes precedence.<p>

.B Default:
 	none (i.e., no hosts specifically excluded)<p>

.B Example:
  	deny hosts = 150.203.4. badhost.mynet.edu.au<p>

<a name="delete veto files">
<H3>delete veto files (S)</H3><p>

This option is used when Samba is attempting to delete a directory
that contains one or more vetoed directories (see the 'veto files' option).
If this option is set to False (the default) then if a vetoed directory
contains any non-vetoed files or directories then the directory delete 
will fail. This is usually what you want. <p>

If this option is set to True, then Samba will attempt
to recursively delete any files and directories within the vetoed
directory. This can be useful for integration with file serving
systems such as Netatalk, which create meta-files within directories
you might normally veto DOS/Windows users from seeing (eg. .AppleDouble)<p>

Setting 'delete veto files = True' allows these directories to be 
transparently deleted when the parent directory is deleted (so long
as the user has permissions to do so).<p>

.B Default:
    delete veto files = False<p>

.B Example:
    delete veto files = True<p>

See
.B veto files<p>

<a name="dfree command">
<H3>dfree command (G)</H3>
The dfree command setting should only be used on systems where a
problem occurs with the internal disk space calculations. This has
been known to happen with Ultrix, but may occur with other operating
systems. The symptom that was seen was an error of "Abort Retry
Ignore" at the end of each directory listing.<p>

This setting allows the replacement of the internal routines to
calculate the total disk space and amount available with an external
routine. The example below gives a possible script that might fulfill
this function. <p>

The external program will be passed a single parameter indicating a
directory in the filesystem being queried. This will typically consist
of the string "./". The script should return two integers in ascii. The
first should be the total disk space in blocks, and the second should
be the number of available blocks. An optional third return value
can give the block size in bytes. The default blocksize is 1024 bytes.<p>

Note: Your script should NOT be setuid or setgid and should be owned by
(and writable only by) root!<p>

.B Default:
 	By default internal routines for determining the disk capacity
and remaining space will be used.<p>

.B Example:
 	dfree command = /usr/local/samba/bin/dfree<p>

	Where the script dfree (which must be made executable) could be<p>

.nf
	#!/bin/sh
	df $1 | tail -1 | awk '{print $2" "$4}'
.fi<p>

	or perhaps (on Sys V)<p>

.nf
	#!/bin/sh
	/usr/bin/df -k $1 | tail -1 | awk '{print $3" "$5}'
.fi<p>

	Note that you may have to replace the command names with full
path names on some systems.
<a name="directory">
<H3>directory (S)</H3>
See
.B path.<p>

<a name="directory mask">
<H3>directory mask (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'directory mode'.<p>

This parameter is the octal modes which are used when converting DOS modes 
to UNIX modes when creating UNIX directories.<p>

When a directory is created, the neccessary permissions are calculated
according to the mapping from DOS modes to UNIX permissions, and
the resulting UNIX mode is then bit-wise 'AND'ed with this parameter.
This parameter may be thought of as a bit-wise MASK for the UNIX
modes of a directory. Any bit *not* set here will be removed from the
modes set on a directory when it is created.<p>

The default value of this parameter removes the 'group' and 'other'
write bits from the UNIX mode, allowing only the user who owns the
directory to modify it.<p>

Following this Samba will bit-wise 'OR' the UNIX mode created from
this parameter with the value of the "force directory mode" parameter. 
This parameter is set to 000 by default (ie. no extra mode bits are added).<p>

See the "force directory mode" parameter to cause particular mode
bits to always be set on created directories.<p>

See also the "create mode" parameter for masking mode bits on created
files.<p>

.B Default:
 	directory mask = 0755<p>

.B Example:
 	directory mask = 0775<p>

<a name="directory mode">
<H3>directory mode (S)</H3>
See
.B directory mask.<p>

<a name="dns proxy">
<H3>dns proxy (G)</H3><p>

Specifies that nmbd should (as a WINS server), on finding that a NetBIOS
name has not been registered, treat the NetBIOS name word-for-word as
a DNS name.<p>

Note that the maximum length for a NetBIOS name is 15
characters, so the DNS name (or DNS alias) can likewise only be 15
characters, maximum.<p>

Note also that nmbd will block completely until the DNS name is resolved.
This will result in temporary loss of browsing and WINS services.
Enable this option only if you are certain that DNS resolution is fast,
or you can live with the consequences of periodic pauses in nmbd service.<p>

.B Default:
	 dns proxy = yes<p>

<a name="domain controller">
<H3>domain controller (G)</H3><p>

Specifies the DNS name or IP address of the machine to refer domain 
logons from Win95 machines to. You should never need to set this parameter.<p>

.B Default:
	 domain controller = no<p>

<a name="domain logons">
<H3>domain logons (G)</H3><p>

If set to true, the Samba server will serve Windows 95 domain logons
for the workgroup it is in. For more details on setting up this feature
see the file DOMAINS.txt in the Samba source documentation directory.<p>

.B Default:
	 domain logons = no<p>

<a name="domain master">
<H3>domain master (G)</H3><p>

Enable WAN-wide browse list collation.  Local master browsers on 
broadcast-isolated subnets will give samba their local browse lists, and 
ask for a complete copy of the browse list for the whole wide area network.
Browser clients will then contact their local master browser, and will
receive the domain-wide browse list, instead of just the list for their
broadcast-isolated subnet.<p>

.B Default:
 	domain master = no<p>

<a name="dont descend">
<H3>dont descend (S)</H3>
There are certain directories on some systems (eg., the /proc tree under
Linux) that are either not of interest to clients or are infinitely deep
(recursive). This parameter allows you to specify a comma-delimited list
of directories that the server should always show as empty.<p>

Note that Samba can be very fussy about the exact format of the "dont
descend" entries. For example you may need "./proc" instead of just
"/proc". Experimentation is the best policy :-)<p>

.B Default:
 	none (i.e., all directories are OK to descend)<p>

.B Example:
  	dont descend = /proc,/dev<p>

<a name="dos filetimes">
<H3>dos filetimes (S)</H3>
Under DOS and Windows, if a user can write to a file they can change
the timestamp on it. Under POSIX semantics, only the owner of the file
or root may change the timestamp. By default, Samba runs with POSIX
semantics and refuses to change the timestamp on a file if the user
smbd is acting on behalf of is not the file owner. Setting this option
to True allows DOS semantics and smbd will change the file timstamp as 
DOS requires. This is a correct implementation of a previous compile-time
options (UTIME_WORKAROUND) which was broken and is now removed.<p>

.B Default:
        dos filetimes = False<p>

.B Example:
        dos filetimes = True<p>

<a name="dos filetime resolution">
<H3>dos filetime resolution (S)</H3>
Under the DOS and Windows FAT filesystem, the finest granulatity on
time resolution is two seconds. Setting this parameter for a share
causes Samba to round the reported time down to the nearest two
second boundary when a query call that requires one second resolution
is made to smbd. <p>

This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ 
when used against Samba shares. If oplocks are enabled on a share,
Visual C++ uses two different time reading calls to check if a file 
has changed since it was last read. One of these calls uses a one-second 
granularity, the other uses a two second granularity. As the two second 
call rounds any odd second down, then if the file has a timestamp of an 
odd number of seconds then the two timestamps will not match and Visual 
C++ will keep reporting the file has changed. Setting this option causes 
the two timestamps to match, and Visual C++ is happy.<p>

.B Default:
        dos filetime resolution = False<p>

.B Example:
        dos filetime resolution = True<p>

<a name="encrypt passwords">
<H3>encrypt passwords (G)</H3><p>

This boolean controls whether encrypted passwords will be negotiated
with the client. Note that this option has no effect if you haven't
compiled in the necessary des libraries and encryption code. It
defaults to no.<p>

<a name="exec">
<H3>exec (S)</H3><p>

This is an alias for preexec<p>

<a name="fake oplocks">
<H3>fake oplocks (S)</H3><p>

Oplocks are the way that SMB clients get permission from a server to
locally cache file operations. If a server grants an oplock
(opportunistic lock) then the client is free to assume that it is the
only one accessing the file and it will aggressively cache file
data. With some oplock types the client may even cache file open/close
operations. This can give enormous performance benefits.<p>

When you set "fake oplocks = yes" Samba will always grant oplock
requests no matter how many clients are using the file. <p>

By enabling this option on all read-only shares or shares that you know
will only be accessed from one client at a time you will see a big
performance improvement on many operations. If you enable this option
on shares where multiple clients may be accessing the files read-write
at the same time you can get data corruption. Use this option
carefully! <p>

It is generally much better to use the real oplock support except for
physically read-only media such as CDROMs.<p>

This option is disabled by default.<p>

<a name="follow symlinks">
<H3>follow symlinks (S)</H3><p>

This parameter allows the Samba administrator to stop smbd from
following symbolic links in a particular share. Setting this
parameter to "No" prevents any file or directory that is a 
symbolic link from being followed (the user will get an error).
This option is very useful to stop users from adding a symbolic
link to /etc/pasword in their home directory for instance.
However it will slow filename lookups down slightly.<p>

This option is enabled (ie. smbd will follow symbolic links)
by default.<p>

<a name="force create mode">
<H3>force create mode (S)</H3>
This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit permissions that
will *always* be set on a file created by Samba. This is done
by bitwise 'OR'ing these bits onto the mode bits of a file that
is being created. The default for this parameter is (in octel)
000. The modes in this parameter are bitwise 'OR'ed onto the
file mode after the mask set in the "create mask" parameter
is applied.<p>

See also the parameter "create mask" for details on masking mode
bits on created files.<p>

.B Default:
       force create mode = 000<p>

.B Example:
       force create mode = 0755<p>

would force all created files to have read and execute permissions
set for 'group' and 'other' as well as the read/write/execute bits 
set for the 'user'.<p>

<a name="force directory mode">
<H3>force directory mode (S)</H3>
This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit permissions that
will *always* be set on a directory created by Samba. This is done
by bitwise 'OR'ing these bits onto the mode bits of a directory that
is being created. The default for this parameter is (in octel)
0000 which will not add any extra permission bits to a created
directory. This operation is done after the mode mask in the parameter 
"directory mask" is applied.<p>

See also the parameter "directory mask" for details on masking mode
bits on created directories.<p>

.B Default:
       force directory mode = 000<p>

.B Example:
       force directory mode = 0755<p>

would force all created directories to have read and execute permissions
set for 'group' and 'other' as well as the read/write/execute bits 
set for the 'user'.<p>

<a name="force group">
<H3>force group (S)</H3>
This specifies a group name that all connections to this service
should be made as. This may be useful for sharing files.<p>

.B Default:
       no forced group<p>

.B Example:
       force group = agroup<p>

<a name="force user">
<H3>force user (S)</H3>
This specifies a user name that all connections to this service
should be made as. This may be useful for sharing files. You should
also use it carefully as using it incorrectly can cause security
problems.<p>

This user name only gets used once a connection is established. Thus
clients still need to connect as a valid user and supply a valid
password. Once connected, all file operations will be performed as the
"forced user", not matter what username the client connected as.<p>

.B Default:
       no forced user<p>

.B Example:
       force user = auser<p>

<a name="getwd cache">
<H3>getwd cache (G)</H3>
This is a tuning option. When this is enabled a cacheing algorithm will
be used to reduce the time taken for getwd() calls. This can have a
significant impact on performance, especially when widelinks is False.<p>

.B Default:
 	getwd cache = No<p>

.B Example:
 	getwd cache = Yes<p>

<a name="group">
<H3>group (S)</H3>
This is an alias for "force group" and is only kept for compatibility
with old versions of Samba. It may be removed in future versions.<p>

<a name="guest account">
<H3>guest account (S)</H3>
This is a username which will be used for access to services which are
specified as 'guest ok' (see below). Whatever privileges this user has
will be available to any client connecting to the guest
service. Typically this user will exist in the password file, but will
not have a valid login. If a username is specified in a given service,
the specified username overrides this one.<p>

One some systems the account "nobody" may not be able to print. Use
another account in this case. You should test this by trying to log in
as your guest user (perhaps by using the "su \-" command) and trying to
print using
.BR lpr .<p>

Note that as of version 1.9 of Samba this option may be set
differently for each service.<p>

.B Default:
 	specified at compile time<p>

.B Example:
 	guest account = nobody
<a name="guest ok">
<H3>guest ok (S)</H3>
See
.B public.
<a name="guest only">
<H3>guest only (S)</H3>
If this parameter is 'yes' for a service, then only guest connections to the
service are permitted. This parameter will have no affect if "guest ok" or
"public" is not set for the service.<p>

See the section below on user/password validation for more information about
this option.<p>

.B Default:
 	guest only = no<p>

.B Example:
 	guest only = yes
<a name="hide dot files">
<H3>hide dot files (S)</H3>
This is a boolean parameter that controls whether files starting with
a dot appear as hidden files.<p>

.B Default:
	hide dot files = yes<p>

.B Example:
	hide dot files = no<p>


<a name="hide file">
<H3>hide files(S)</H3>
This is a list of files or directories that are not visible but are
accessible.  The DOS 'hidden' attribute is applied to any files or
directories that match.<p>

Each entry in the list must be separated by a "/", which allows spaces
to be included in the entry.  '*' and '?' can be used to specify multiple 
files or directories as in DOS wildcards.<p>

Each entry must be a unix path, not a DOS path and must not include the 
unix directory separator "/".<p>

Note that the case sensitivity option is applicable in hiding files.<p>

Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, as
it will be forced to check all files and directories for a match
as they are scanned.<p>

See also "hide dot files", "veto files" and "case sensitive"<p>

.B Default
	No files or directories are hidden by this option (dot files are
    hidden by default because of the "hide dot files" option).<p>

.B Example
	hide files = /.*/DesktopFolderDB/TrashFor%m/resource.frk/<p>

The above example is based on files that the Macintosh client (DAVE)
creates for internal use, and also still hides all files beginning with
a dot.<p>

<a name="homedir map">
<H3>homedir map (G)</H3>
If "nis homedir" is true, this parameter specifies the NIS (or YP) map
from which the server for the user's home directory should be extracted.
At present, only the Sun auto.home map format is understood. The form of
the map is:<p>

username	server:/some/file/system<p>

and the program will extract the servername from before the first ':'.
There should probably be a better parsing system that copes with different
map formats and also Amd (another automounter) maps.<p>

NB: The -DNETGROUP option is required in the Makefile for option to work
and on some architectures the line -lrpcsvc needs to be added to the
LIBSM variable. This is required for Solaris 2, FreeBSD and HPUX.<p>

See also "nis homedir"<p>

.B Default:
	homedir map = auto.home<p>

.B Example:
	homedir map = amd.homedir
<a name="hosts allow">
<H3>hosts allow (S)</H3>
See
.B allow hosts.
<a name="hosts deny">
<H3>hosts deny (S)</H3>
See
.B deny hosts.<p>

<a name="hosts equiv">
<H3>hosts equiv (G)</H3>
If this global parameter is a non-null string, it specifies the name of
a file to read for the names of hosts and users who will be allowed access
without specifying a password.<p>

This is not be confused with 
.B allow hosts
which is about hosts access to services and is more useful for guest services.
.B hosts equiv
may be useful for NT clients which will not supply passwords to samba.<p>

NOTE: The use of hosts.equiv can be a major security hole. This is
because you are trusting the PC to supply the correct username. It is
very easy to get a PC to supply a false username. I recommend that the
hosts.equiv option be only used if you really know what you are doing,
or perhaps on a home network where you trust your wife and kids :-)<p>

.B Default
	No host equivalences<p>

.B Example
	hosts equiv = /etc/hosts.equiv<p>

<a name="include">
<H3>include (G)</H3><p>

This allows you to include one config file inside another.  The file is
included literally, as though typed in place.<p>

It takes the standard substitutions, except %u, %P and %S<p>

<a name="interfaces">
<H3>interfaces (G)</H3><p>

This option allows you to setup multiple network interfaces, so that
Samba can properly handle browsing on all interfaces.<p>

The option takes a list of ip/netmask pairs. The netmask may either be
a bitmask, or a bitlength. <p>

For example, the following line:<p>

interfaces = 192.168.2.10/24 192.168.3.10/24<p>

would configure two network interfaces with IP addresses 192.168.2.10
and 192.168.3.10. The netmasks of both interfaces would be set to
255.255.255.0. <p>

You could produce an equivalent result by using:<p>

interfaces = 192.168.2.10/255.255.255.0 192.168.3.10/255.255.255.0<p>

if you prefer that format.<p>

If this option is not set then Samba will attempt to find a primary
interface, but won't attempt to configure more than one interface.<p>

<a name="invalid users">
<H3>invalid users (S)</H3>
This is a list of users that should not be allowed to login to this
service. This is really a "paranoid" check to absolutely ensure an
improper setting does not breach your security.<p>

A name starting with @ is interpreted as a UNIX group.<p>

The current servicename is substituted for %S. This is useful in the
[homes] section.<p>

See also "valid users"<p>

.B Default
	No invalid users<p>

.B Example
	invalid users = root fred admin @wheel<p>

<a name="keepalive">
<H3>keepalive (G)</H3>
The value of the parameter (an integer) represents the number of seconds 
between 'keepalive' packets. If this parameter is zero, no keepalive packets
will be sent. Keepalive packets, if sent, allow the server to tell whether a
client is still present and responding.<p>

Keepalives should, in general, not be needed if the socket being used
has the SO_KEEPALIVE attribute set on it (see "socket
options"). Basically you should only use this option if you strike
difficulties.<p>

.B Default:
 	keep alive = 0<p>

.B Example:
 	keep alive = 60<p>

<a name="lm announce">
<H3>lm announce (G)</H3><p>

This parameter determines if Samba will produce Lanman announce
broadcasts that are needed by OS/2 clients in order for them to
see the Samba server in their browse list. This parameter can
have three values, true, false, or auto. The default is auto.
If set to False Samba will never produce these broadcasts. If
set to true Samba will produce Lanman announce broadcasts at
a frequency set by the parameter 'lm interval'. If set to auto
Samba will not send Lanman announce broadcasts by default but
will listen for them. If it hears such a broadcast on the wire
it will then start sending them at a frequency set by the parameter 
'lm interval'.<p>

See also "lm interval".<p>

.B Default:
       lm announce = auto<p>

.B Example:
       lm announce = true<p>

<a name="lm interval">
<H3>lm interval (G)</H3><p>

If Samba is set to produce Lanman announce broadcasts needed
by OS/2 clients (see the "lm announce" parameter) this parameter
defines the frequency in seconds with which they will be made.
If this is set to zero then no Lanman announcements will be
made despite the setting of the "lm announce" parameter.<p>

See also "lm announce".<p>

.B Default:
        lm interval = 60<p>

.B Example:
        lm interval = 120<p>

<a name="load printers">
<H3>load printers (G)</H3>
A boolean variable that controls whether all printers in the printcap
will be loaded for browsing by default. <p>

.B Default:
	load printers = yes<p>

.B Example:
	load printers = no<p>

<a name="local master">
<H3>local master (G)</H3>
This option allows the nmbd to become a local master browser on a
subnet. If set to False then nmbd will not attempt to become a local
master browser on a subnet and will also lose in all browsing elections. 
By default this value is set to true. Setting this value to true doesn't 
mean that Samba will become the local master browser on a subnet, just 
that the nmbd will participate in elections for local master browser.<p>

.B Default:
	local master = yes<p>

<a name="lock directory">
<H3>lock directory (G)</H3>
This option specifies the directory where lock files will be placed.
The lock files are used to implement the "max connections" option.<p>

.B Default:
	lock directory = /tmp/samba<p>

.B Example: 
	lock directory = /usr/local/samba/var/locks<p>

<a name="locking">
<H3>locking (S)</H3>
This controls whether or not locking will be performed by the server in 
response to lock requests from the client.<p>

If "locking = no", all lock and unlock requests will appear to succeed and 
all lock queries will indicate that the queried lock is clear.<p>

If "locking = yes", real locking will be performed by the server.<p>

This option may be particularly useful for read-only filesystems which
do not need locking (such as cdrom drives).<p>

Be careful about disabling locking either globally or in a specific
service, as lack of locking may result in data corruption.<p>

.B Default:
 	locking = yes<p>

.B Example:
 	locking = no<p>

<a name="log file">
<H3>log file (G)</H3><p>

This options allows you to override the name of the Samba log file
(also known as the debug file).<p>

This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate log files for each user or machine.<p>

.B Example:
	log file = /usr/local/samba/var/log.%m<p>

<a name="log level">
<H3>log level (G)</H3>
see "debug level"<p>

<a name="logon drive">
<H3>logon drive (G)</H3><p>

This parameter specifies the local path to which the home directory
will be connected (see "logon home") and is only used by NT Workstations.<p>

.B Example:
	logon drive = h:<p>

<a name="logon home">
<H3>logon home (G)</H3><p>

This parameter specifies the home directory location when a Win95 or
NT Workstation logs into a Samba PDC.  It allows you to do "NET USE
H: /HOME" from a command prompt, for example.<p>

.B
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate logon scripts for each user or machine.<p>

.B Example:
	logon home = "\\\\remote_smb_server\\%U"<p>

.B Default:
	logon home = "\\\\%N\\%U"<p>

<a name="logon path">
<H3>logon path (G)</H3><p>

This parameter specifies the home directory where roaming profiles 
(USER.DAT / USER.MAN files for Windows 95) are stored.<p>

This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate logon scripts for each user or machine.  It also specifies
the directory from which the "desktop", "start menu", "nethood" and
"programs" folders, and their contents, are loaded and displayed
on your Windows 95 client.<p>

The share and the path must be readable by the user for the preferences
and directories to be loaded onto the Windows 95 client.  The share
must be writeable when the logs in for the first time, in order that
the Windows 95 client can create the user.dat and other directories.<p>

Thereafter, the directories and any of contents can, if required,
be made read-only.  It is not adviseable that the USER.DAT file be made
read-only - rename it to USER.MAN to achieve the desired effect
(a MANdatory profile).<p>

Windows clients can sometimes maintain a connection to the [homes]
share, even though there is no user logged in.  Therefore, it is
vital that the logon path does not include a reference to the
homes share (i.e \\\\%N\\HOMES\profile_path will cause problems).<p>

.B
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate logon scripts for each user or machine.<p>

.B Default:
 	logon path = \\\\%N\\%U\\profile<p>

.B Example:
	logon path = \\\\PROFILESERVER\\HOME_DIR\\%U\\PROFILE<p>

<a name="logon script">
<H3>logon script (G)</H3><p>

This parameter specifies the batch file (.bat) or NT command file (.cmd)
to be downloaded and run on a machine when a user successfully logs in.
The file must contain the DOS style cr/lf line endings.  Using a DOS-style
editor to create the file is recommended.<p>

The script must be a relative path to the [netlogon] service.  If the
[netlogon] service specifies a path of /usr/local/samba/netlogon, and
logon script = STARTUP.BAT, then file that will be downloaded is:<p>

.B /usr/local/samba/netlogon/STARTUP.BAT<p>

The contents of the batch file is entirely your choice.  A suggested
command would be to add NET TIME \\\\SERVER /SET /YES, to force every
machine to synchronise clocks with the same time server.  Another use
would be to add NET USE U: \\\\SERVER\\UTILS for commonly used utilities,
or NET USE Q: \\\\SERVER\\ISO9001_QA.<p>

Note that it is particularly important not to allow write access to
the [netlogon] share, or to grant users write permission on the
batch files in a secure environment, as this would allow the batch
files to be arbitrarily modified.<p>

.B
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate logon scripts for each user or machine.<p>

.B Example:
	logon script = scripts/%U.bat<p>

<a name="lppause command">
<H3>lppause command (S)</H3>
This parameter specifies the command to be executed on the server host in
order to stop printing or spooling a specific print job.<p>

This command should be a program or script which takes a printer name and
job number to pause the print job. Currently I don't know of any print
spooler system that can do this with a simple option, except for the PPR
system from Trinity College (ppr\-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr). One way
of implementing this is by using job priorities, where jobs having a too
low priority won't be sent to the printer. See also the
.B lppause
command.<p>

If a %p is given then the printername is put in its place. A %j is
replaced with the job number (an integer).
On HPUX (see printing=hpux), if the -p%p option is added to the lpq
command, the job will show up with the correct status, i.e. if the job
priority is lower than the set fence priority it will have the PAUSED
status, whereas if the priority is equal or higher it will have the
SPOOLED or PRINTING status.<p>

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path in the lppause
command as the PATH may not be available to the server.<p>

.B Default:
        Currently no default value is given to this string<p>

.B Example for HPUX:
        lppause command = /usr/bin/lpalt %p-%j -p0<p>

<a name="lpq cache time">
<H3>lpq cache time (G)</H3><p>

This controls how long lpq info will be cached for to prevent the lpq
command being called too often. A separate cache is kept for each
variation of the lpq command used by the system, so if you use
different lpq commands for different users then they won't share cache
information.<p>

The cache files are stored in /tmp/lpq.xxxx where xxxx is a hash
of the lpq command in use.<p>

The default is 10 seconds, meaning that the cached results of a
previous identical lpq command will be used if the cached data is less
than 10 seconds old. A large value may be advisable if your lpq
command is very slow.<p>

A value of 0 will disable cacheing completely.<p>

.B Default:
	lpq cache time = 10<p>

.B Example:
	lpq cache time = 30<p>

<a name="lpq command">
<H3>lpq command (S)</H3>
This parameter specifies the command to be executed on the server host in
order to obtain "lpq"-style printer status information. <p>

This command should be a program or script which takes a printer name
as its only parameter and outputs printer status information. <p>

Currently six styles of printer status information are supported; BSD,
SYSV, AIX, HPUX, QNX, LPRNG and PLP. This covers most UNIX systems. You
control which type is expected using the "printing =" option.<p>

Some clients (notably Windows for Workgroups) may not correctly send the
connection number for the printer they are requesting status information
about. To get around this, the server reports on the first printer service
connected to by the client. This only happens if the connection number sent
is invalid.<p>

If a %p is given then the printername is put in its place. Otherwise
it is placed at the end of the command.<p>

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path in the lpq
command as the PATH may not be available to the server.<p>

.B Default:
        depends on the setting of "printing ="<p>

.B Example:
 	lpq command = /usr/bin/lpq %p<p>

<a name="lpresume command">
<H3>lpresume command (S)</H3>
This parameter specifies the command to be executed on the server host in
order to restart or continue printing or spooling a specific print job.<p>

This command should be a program or script which takes a printer name and
job number to resume the print job. See also the lppause command.<p>

If a %p is given then the printername is put in its place. A %j is
replaced with the job number (an integer).<p>

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path in the lpresume
command as the PATH may not be available to the server.<p>

.B Default:
        Currently no default value is given to this string<p>

.B Example for HPUX:
        lpresume command = /usr/bin/lpalt %p-%j -p2<p>

<a name="lprm command">
<H3>lprm command (S)</H3>
This parameter specifies the command to be executed on the server host in
order to delete a print job.<p>

This command should be a program or script which takes a printer name
and job number, and deletes the print job.<p>

Currently seven styles of printer control are supported; BSD, SYSV, AIX
HPUX, QNX, LPRNG and PLP. This covers most UNIX systems. You control
which type is expected using the "printing =" option.<p>

If a %p is given then the printername is put in its place. A %j is
replaced with the job number (an integer).<p>

Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path in the lprm
command as the PATH may not be available to the server.<p>

.B Default:
        depends on the setting of "printing ="<p>

.B Example 1:
 	lprm command = /usr/bin/lprm -P%p %j<p>

.B Example 2:
 	lprm command = /usr/bin/cancel %p-%j<p>

<a name="magic output">
<H3>magic output (S)</H3>
This parameter specifies the name of a file which will contain output
created by a magic script (see
.I magic script
below).<p>

Warning: If two clients use the same magic script in the same directory the
output file content is undefined.
.B Default:
 	magic output = <magic script name>.out<p>

.B Example:
 	magic output = myfile.txt
<a name="magic script">
<H3>magic script (S)</H3>
This parameter specifies the name of a file which, if opened, will be
executed by the server when the file is closed. This allows a UNIX script
to be sent to the Samba host and executed on behalf of the connected user.<p>

Scripts executed in this way will be deleted upon completion, permissions
permitting.<p>

If the script generates output, output will be sent to the file specified by
the
.I magic output
parameter (see above).<p>

Note that some shells are unable to interpret scripts containing
carriage-return-linefeed instead of linefeed as the end-of-line
marker. Magic scripts must be executable "as is" on the host, which
for some hosts and some shells will require filtering at the DOS end.<p>

Magic scripts are EXPERIMENTAL and should NOT be relied upon.<p>

.B Default:
 	None. Magic scripts disabled.<p>

.B Example:
 	magic script = user.csh<p>

<a name="mangle case">
<H3>mangle case (S)</H3><p>

See the section on "NAME MANGLING"<p>

<a name="mangled map">
<H3>mangled map (S)</H3>
This is for those who want to directly map UNIX file names which are
not representable on DOS.  The mangling of names is not always what is
needed.  In particular you may have documents with file extensions
that differ between DOS and UNIX. For example, under UNIX it is common
to use .html for HTML files, whereas under DOS .htm is more commonly
used.<p>

So to map 'html' to 'htm' you put:<p>

  mangled map = (*.html *.htm)<p>

One very useful case is to remove the annoying ;1 off the ends of
filenames on some CDROMS (only visible under some UNIXes). To do this
use a map of (*;1 *)<p>

.B default:
	no mangled map<p>

.B Example:
	mangled map = (*;1 *)<p>

<a name="mangled names">
<H3>mangled names (S)</H3>
This controls whether non-DOS names under UNIX should be mapped to
DOS-compatible names ("mangled") and made visible, or whether non-DOS names
should simply be ignored.<p>

See the section on "NAME MANGLING" for details on how to control the
mangling process.<p>

If mangling is used then the mangling algorithm is as follows:
.RS
- the first (up to) five alphanumeric characters before the rightmost dot of
the filename are preserved, forced to upper case, and appear as the first (up
to) five characters of the mangled name.<p>

- a tilde ("~") is appended to the first part of the mangled name, followed
by a two-character unique sequence, based on the original root name 
(i.e., the original filename minus its final extension). The final
extension is included in the hash calculation only if it contains any upper
case characters or is longer than three characters.<p>

Note that the character to use may be specified using the "mangling
char" option, if you don't like ~.<p>

- the first three alphanumeric characters of the final extension are preserved,
forced to upper case and appear as the extension of the mangled name. The 
final extension is defined as that part of the original filename after the
rightmost dot. If there are no dots in the filename, the mangled name will
have no extension (except in the case of hidden files - see below).<p>

- files whose UNIX name begins with a dot will be presented as DOS hidden
files. The mangled name will be created as for other filenames, but with the
leading dot removed and "___" as its extension regardless of actual original
extension (that's three underscores).
.RE<p>

The two-digit hash value consists of upper case alphanumeric characters.<p>

This algorithm can cause name collisions only if files in a directory share
the same first five alphanumeric characters. The probability of such a clash 
is 1/1300.<p>

The name mangling (if enabled) allows a file to be copied between UNIX
directories from DOS while retaining the long UNIX filename. UNIX files can
be renamed to a new extension from DOS and will retain the same basename. 
Mangled names do not change between sessions.<p>

.B Default:
 	mangled names = yes<p>

.B Example:
 	mangled names = no
<a name="mangling char">
<H3>mangling char (S)</H3>
This controls what character is used as the "magic" character in name
mangling. The default is a ~ but this may interfere with some
software. Use this option to set it to whatever you prefer.<p>

.B Default:
 	mangling char = ~<p>

.B Example:
 	mangling char = ^<p>

<a name="mangled stack">
<H3>mangled stack (G)</H3>
This parameter controls the number of mangled names that should be cached in
the Samba server.<p>

This stack is a list of recently mangled base names (extensions are only
maintained if they are longer than 3 characters or contains upper case
characters).<p>

The larger this value, the more likely it is that mangled names can be
successfully converted to correct long UNIX names. However, large stack
sizes will slow most directory access. Smaller stacks save memory in the
server (each stack element costs 256 bytes).<p>

It is not possible to absolutely guarantee correct long file names, so
be prepared for some surprises!<p>

.B Default:
 	mangled stack = 50<p>

.B Example:
 	mangled stack = 100<p>

<a name="map archive">
<H3>map archive (S)</H3>
This controls whether the DOS archive attribute should be mapped to the
UNIX owner execute bit.  The DOS archive bit is set when a file has been modified
since its last backup.  One motivation for this option it to keep Samba/your
PC from making any file it touches from becoming executable under UNIX.
This can be quite annoying for shared source code, documents,  etc...<p>

Note that this requires the 'create mask' to be set such that owner
execute bit is not masked out (ie. it must include 100). See the 
parameter "create mask" for details.<p>

.B Default:
      map archive = yes<p>

.B Example:
      map archive = no<p>

<a name="map hidden">
<H3>map hidden (S)</H3>
This controls whether DOS style hidden files should be mapped to the
UNIX world execute bit.<p>

Note that this requires the 'create mask' to be set such that the world
execute bit is not masked out (ie. it must include 001). 
See the parameter "create mask" for details.<p>

.B Default:
 	map hidden = no<p>

.B Example:
 	map hidden = yes
<a name="map system">
<H3>map system (S)</H3>
This controls whether DOS style system files should be mapped to the
UNIX group execute bit.<p>

Note that this requires the 'create mask' to be set such that the group
execute bit is not masked out (ie. it must include 010). See the parameter 
"create mask" for details.<p>

.B Default:
 	map system = no<p>

.B Example:
 	map system = yes
<a name="max connections">
<H3>max connections (S)</H3>
This option allows the number of simultaneous connections to a
service to be limited. If "max connections" is greater than 0 then
connections will be refused if this number of connections to the
service are already open. A value of zero mean an unlimited number of
connections may be made.<p>

Record lock files are used to implement this feature. The lock files
will be stored in the directory specified by the "lock directory" option.<p>

.B Default:
	max connections = 0<p>

.B Example:
	max connections = 10<p>

<a name="max disk size">
<H3>max disk size (G)</H3>
This option allows you to put an upper limit on the apparent size of
disks. If you set this option to 100 then all shares will appear to be
not larger than 100 MB in size.<p>

Note that this option does not limit the amount of data you can put on
the disk. In the above case you could still store much more than 100
MB on the disk, but if a client ever asks for the amount of free disk
space or the total disk size then the result will be bounded by the
amount specified in "max disk size".<p>

This option is primarily useful to work around bugs in some pieces of
software that can't handle very large disks, particularly disks over
1GB in size.<p>

A "max disk size" of 0 means no limit.<p>

.B Default:
	max disk size = 0<p>

.B Example:
	max disk size = 1000<p>

<a name="max log size">
<H3>max log size (G)</H3><p>

This option (an integer in kilobytes) specifies the max size the log
file should grow to. Samba periodically checks the size and if it is
exceeded it will rename the file, adding a .old extension.<p>

A size of 0 means no limit.<p>

.B Default:
	max log size = 5000<p>

.B Example:
 	max log size = 1000<p>

<a name="max mux">
<H3>max mux (G)</H3><p>

This option controls the maximum number of outstanding simultaneous SMB 
operations that samba tells the client it will allow. You should never need 
to set this parameter.<p>

.B Default:
	max mux = 50<p>

<a name="max packet">
<H3>max packet (G)</H3><p>

A synonym for this parameter is 'packet size'.<p>

<a name="max ttl">
<H3>max ttl (G)</H3><p>

This option tells nmbd what the default 'time to live' of NetBIOS
names should be (in seconds) when nmbd is requesting a name using
either a broadcast or from a WINS server. You should never need to 
change this parameter.<p>

.B Default:
	max ttl = 14400<p>

<a name="max wins ttl">
<H3>max wins ttl (G)</H3><p>

This option tells nmbd when acting as a WINS server (wins support = true)
what the maximum 'time to live' of NetBIOS names that nmbd will grant will
be (in seconds). You should never need to change this parameter.     
The default is 3 days (259200 seconds).<p>

.B Default:
        max wins ttl = 259200<p>

<a name="max xmit">
<H3>max xmit (G)</H3><p>

This option controls the maximum packet size that will be negotiated
by Samba. The default is 65535, which is the maximum. In some cases
you may find you get better performance with a smaller value. A value
below 2048 is likely to cause problems.<p>

.B Default:
	max xmit = 65535<p>

.B Example:
 	max xmit = 8192<p>

<a name="message command">
<H3>message command (G)</H3><p>

This specifies what command to run when the server receives a WinPopup
style message.<p>

This would normally be a command that would deliver the message
somehow. How this is to be done is up to your imagination.<p>

What I use is:<p>

   message command = csh -c 'xedit %s;rm %s' &<p>

This delivers the message using xedit, then removes it
afterwards. NOTE THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS COMMAND RETURN
IMMEDIATELY. That's why I have the & on the end. If it doesn't return
immediately then your PCs may freeze when sending messages (they
should recover after 30secs, hopefully).<p>

All messages are delivered as the global guest user. The command takes
the standard substitutions, although %u won't work (%U may be better
in this case).<p>

Apart from the standard substitutions, some additional ones apply. In
particular:<p>

%s = the filename containing the message<p>

%t = the destination that the message was sent to (probably the server
name)<p>

%f = who the message is from<p>

You could make this command send mail, or whatever else takes your
fancy. Please let me know of any really interesting ideas you have.<p>

Here's a way of sending the messages as mail to root:<p>

message command = /bin/mail -s 'message from %f on %m' root < %s; rm %s<p>

If you don't have a message command then the message won't be
delivered and Samba will tell the sender there was an
error. Unfortunately WfWg totally ignores the error code and carries
on regardless, saying that the message was delivered.<p>

If you want to silently delete it then try "message command = rm %s".<p>

For the really adventurous, try something like this:<p>

message command = csh -c 'csh < %s |& /usr/local/samba/bin/smbclient \e
                  -M %m; rm %s' &<p>

this would execute the command as a script on the server, then give
them the result in a WinPopup message. Note that this could cause a
loop if you send a message from the server using smbclient! You better
wrap the above in a script that checks for this :-)<p>

.B Default:
	no message command<p>

.B Example:
        message command = csh -c 'xedit %s;rm %s' &<p>

<a name="min print space">
<H3>min print space (S)</H3><p>

This sets the minimum amount of free disk space that must be available
before a user will be able to spool a print job. It is specified in
kilobytes. The default is 0, which means no limit.<p>

.B Default:
	min print space = 0<p>

.B Example:
	min print space = 2000<p>

<a name="min wins ttl">
<H3>min wins ttl (G)</H3><p>

This option tells nmbd when acting as a WINS server (wins support = true)
what the minimum 'time to live' of NetBIOS names that nmbd will grant will
be (in seconds). You should never need to change this parameter.
The default is 6 hours (21600 seconds).<p>

.B Default:
        min wins ttl = 21600<p>


<a name="netbios aliases">
<H3>netbios aliases (G)</H3><p>

This is a list of names that nmbd will advertise as additional
names by which the Samba server is known. This allows one machine
to appear in browse lists under multiple names. If a machine is
acting as a browse server or logon server none of these names
will be advertised as either browse server or logon servers, only
the primary name of the machine will be advertised with these
capabilities.<p>

See also 'netbios name'.<p>

.B Example:
   netbios aliases = TEST TEST1 TEST2<p>

<a name="netbios name">
<H3>netbios name (G)</H3><p>

This sets the NetBIOS name by which a Samba server is known. By
default it is the same as the first component of the host's DNS name.
If a machine is a browse server or logon server this name (or the
first component of the hosts DNS name) will be the name that these
services are advertised under.<p>

See also 'netbios aliases'.<p>

.B Example:
   netbios name = MYNAME<p>

<a name="nis homedir">
<H3>nis homedir (G)</H3>
Get the home share server from a NIS (or YP) map. For unix systems that
use an automounter, the user's home directory will often be mounted on
a workstation on demand from a remote server. When the Samba logon server
is not the actual home directory server, two network hops are required
to access the home directory and this can be very slow especially with 
writing via Samba to an NFS mounted directory. This option allows samba
to return the home share as being on a different server to the logon
server and as long as a samba daemon is running on the home directory 
server, it will be mounted on the Samba client directly from the directory
server. When Samba is returning the home share to the client, it will
consult the NIS (or YP) map specified in "homedir map" and return the
server listed there.<p>

.B Default:
	nis homedir = false<p>

.B Example:
	nis homedir = true<p>

<a name="networkstation user login">
<H3>networkstation user login (G)</H3>
This global parameter (new for 1.9.18p3) affects server level security.
With this set (recommended) samba will do a full NetWkstaUserLogon to
confirm that the client really should have login rights. This can cause
problems with machines in trust relationships in which case you can
disable it here, but be warned, we have heard that some NT machines
will then allow anyone in with any password! Make sure you test it.<p>

.B Default:
	networkstation user login = yes<p>

.B Example:
	networkstation user login = no<p>

<a name="null passwords">
<H3>null passwords (G)</H3>
Allow or disallow access to accounts that have null passwords. <p>

.B Default:
	null passwords = no<p>

.B Example:
	null passwords = yes<p>

<a name="only guest">
<H3>only guest (S)</H3>
A synonym for this command is 'guest only'.<p>

<a name="only user">
<H3>only user (S)</H3>
This is a boolean option that controls whether connections with
usernames not in the user= list will be allowed. By default this
option is disabled so a client can supply a username to be used by
the server.<p>

Note that this also means Samba won't try to deduce usernames from the
service name. This can be annoying for the [homes] section. To get
around this you could use "user = %S" which means your "user" list
will be just the service name, which for home directories is the name
of the user.<p>

.B Default: 
	only user = False<p>

.B Example: 
	only user = True<p>

<a name="oplocks">
<H3>oplocks (S)</H3>
This boolean option tells smbd whether to issue oplocks (opportunistic
locks) to file open requests on this share. The oplock code was introduced in
Samba 1.9.18 and can dramatically (approx 30% or more) improve the speed
of access to files on Samba servers. It allows the clients to agressively
cache files locally and you may want to disable this option for unreliable
network environments (it is turned on by default in Windows NT Servers).
For more information see the file Speed.txt in the Samba docs/ directory.<p>

Oplocks may be selectively turned off on certain files on a per share basis.
See the 'veto oplock files' parameter.<p>

.B Default:
    oplocks = True<p>

.B Example:
    oplocks = False<p>


<a name="os level">
<H3>os level (G)</H3>
This integer value controls what level Samba advertises itself as for
browse elections. See BROWSING.txt for details.<p>

<a name="packet size">
<H3>packet size (G)</H3>
The maximum transmit packet size during a raw read. This option is no
longer implemented as of version 1.7.00, and is kept only so old
configuration files do not become invalid.<p>

<a name="passwd chat">
<H3>passwd chat (G)</H3>
This string controls the "chat" conversation that takes places
between smbd and the local password changing program to change the
users password. The string describes a sequence of response-receive
pairs that smbd uses to determine what to send to the passwd program
and what to expect back. If the expected output is not received then
the password is not changed.<p>

This chat sequence is often quite site specific, depending on what
local methods are used for password control (such as NIS+ etc).<p>

The string can contain the macros %o and %n which are substituted for
the old and new passwords respectively. It can also contain the
standard macros \en \er \et and \es to give line-feed, carriage-return,
tab and space.<p>

The string can also contain a * which matches any sequence of
characters.<p>

Double quotes can be used to collect strings with spaces in them into
a single string.<p>

If the send string in any part of the chat sequence is a fullstop "."
then no string is sent. Similarly, is the expect string is a fullstop
then no string is expected.<p>

.B Example:
        passwd chat = "*Enter OLD password*" %o\en "*Enter NEW password*" %n\en \e
                       "*Reenter NEW password*" %n\en "*Password changed*"<p>


.B Default:
       passwd chat = *old*password* %o\en *new*password* %n\en *new*password* %n\en *changed*<p>

<a name="passwd program">
<H3>passwd program (G)</H3>
The name of a program that can be used to set user passwords.<p>

This is only necessary if you have enabled remote password changing at
compile time. Any occurrences of %u will be replaced with the user
name.<p>

Also note that many passwd programs insist in "reasonable" passwords,
such as a minimum length, or the inclusion of mixed case chars and
digits. This can pose a problem as some clients (such as Windows for
Workgroups) uppercase the password before sending it. <p>

.B Default:
	passwd program = /bin/passwd<p>

.B Example:
	passwd program = /sbin/passwd %u<p>

<a name="password level">
<H3>password level (G)</H3>
Some client/server combinations have difficulty with mixed-case passwords.
One offending client is Windows for Workgroups, which for some reason forces
passwords to upper case when using the LANMAN1 protocol, but leaves them alone
when using COREPLUS!<p>

This parameter defines the maximum number of characters that may be upper case
in passwords.<p>

For example, say the password given was "FRED". If
.B password level
is set to 1 (one), the following combinations would be tried if "FRED" failed:
"Fred", "fred", "fRed", "frEd", "freD". If
.B password level was set to 2 (two), the following combinations would also be
tried: "FRed", "FrEd", "FreD", "fREd", "fReD", "frED". And so on.<p>

The higher value this parameter is set to the more likely it is that a mixed
case password will be matched against a single case password. However, you
should be aware that use of this parameter reduces security and increases the
time taken to process a new connection.<p>

A value of zero will cause only two attempts to be made - the password as is
and the password in all-lower case.<p>

If you find the connections are taking too long with this option then
you probably have a slow crypt() routine. Samba now comes with a fast
"ufc crypt" that you can select in the Makefile. You should also make
sure the PASSWORD_LENGTH option is correct for your system in local.h
and includes.h. On most systems only the first 8 chars of a password
are significant so PASSWORD_LENGTH should be 8, but on some longer
passwords are significant. The includes.h file tries to select the
right length for your system.<p>

.B Default:
 	password level = 0<p>

.B Example:
 	password level = 4<p>

<a name="password server">
<H3>password server (G)</H3><p>

By specifying the name of another SMB server (such as a WinNT box)
with this option, and using "security = server" you can get Samba to
do all its username/password validation via a remote server.<p>

This options sets the name of the password server to use. It must be a
netbios name, so if the machine's netbios name is different from its
internet name then you may have to add its netbios name to
/etc/hosts.<p>

The password server much be a machine capable of using the "LM1.2X002"
or the "LM NT 0.12" protocol, and it must be in user level security
mode. <p>

NOTE: Using a password server means your UNIX box (running Samba) is
only as secure as your password server. DO NOT CHOOSE A PASSWORD
SERVER THAT YOU DON'T COMPLETELY TRUST.<p>

Never point a Samba server at itself for password serving. This will
cause a loop and could lock up your Samba server!<p>

The name of the password server takes the standard substitutions, but
probably the only useful one is %m, which means the Samba server will
use the incoming client as the password server. If you use this then
you better trust your clients, and you better restrict them with hosts
allow!<p>

If you list several hosts in the "password server" option then smbd
will try each in turn till it finds one that responds. This is useful
in case your primary server goes down.<p>

If you are using a WindowsNT server as your password server then you
will have to ensure that your users are able to login from the Samba 
server, as the network logon will appear to come from there rather
than from the users workstation.<p>

<a name="path">
<H3>path (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'directory'.<p>

This parameter specifies a directory to which the user of the service is to
be given access. In the case of printable services, this is where print data 
will spool prior to being submitted to the host for printing.<p>

For a printable service offering guest access, the service should be readonly
and the path should be world-writable and have the sticky bit set. This is not
mandatory of course, but you probably won't get the results you expect if you
do otherwise.<p>

Any occurrences of %u in the path will be replaced with the username
that the client is connecting as. Any occurrences of %m will be
replaced by the name of the machine they are connecting from. These
replacements are very useful for setting up pseudo home directories
for users.<p>

Note that this path will be based on 'root dir' if one was specified.
.B Default:
 	none<p>

.B Example:
 	path = /home/fred+ <p>

<a name="postexec">
<H3>postexec (S)</H3><p>

This option specifies a command to be run whenever the service is
disconnected. It takes the usual substitutions. The command may be run
as the root on some systems.<p>

An interesting example may be do unmount server resources:<p>

postexec = /etc/umount /cdrom<p>

See also preexec<p>

.B Default:
      none (no command executed)<p>

.B Example:
      postexec = echo \e"%u disconnected from %S from %m (%I)\e" >> /tmp/log<p>

<a name="postscript">
<H3>postscript (S)</H3>
This parameter forces a printer to interpret the print files as
postscript. This is done by adding a %! to the start of print output. <p>

This is most useful when you have lots of PCs that persist in putting
a control-D at the start of print jobs, which then confuses your
printer.<p>

.B Default: 
	postscript = False<p>

.B Example: 
	postscript = True<p>

<a name="preexec">
<H3>preexec (S)</H3><p>

This option specifies a command to be run whenever the service is
connected to. It takes the usual substitutions.<p>

An interesting example is to send the users a welcome message every
time they log in. Maybe a message of the day? Here is an example:<p>

preexec = csh -c 'echo \e"Welcome to %S!\e" | \e
       /usr/local/samba/bin/smbclient -M %m -I %I' &<p>

Of course, this could get annoying after a while :-)<p>

See also postexec<p>

.B Default:
	none (no command executed)<p>

.B Example:
        preexec = echo \e"%u connected to %S from %m (%I)\e" >> /tmp/log<p>

<a name="preferred master">
<H3>preferred master (G)</H3>
This boolean parameter controls if Samba is a preferred master browser
for its workgroup.
If this is set to true, on startup, samba will force an election, 
and it will have a slight advantage in winning the election.  
It is recommended that this parameter is used in conjunction 
with domain master = yes, so that samba can guarantee becoming 
a domain master.  <p>

Use this option with caution, because if there are several hosts
(whether samba servers, Windows 95 or NT) that are preferred master
browsers on the same subnet, they will each periodically and continuously
attempt to become the local master browser.  This will result in
unnecessary broadcast traffic and reduced browsing capabilities.<p>

See
.B os level = nn<p>

.B Default:
 	preferred master = no<p>

<H3>preload</H3>
This is an alias for "auto services"<p>

<a name="preload">
<H3>preload</H3>
This is an alias for "auto services"<p>

<a name="preserve case">
<H3>preserve case (S)</H3><p>

This controls if new filenames are created with the case that the
client passes, or if they are forced to be the "default" case.<p>

.B Default:
       preserve case = no<p>

See the section on "NAME MANGLING" for a fuller discussion.<p>

<a name="print command">
<H3>print command (S)</H3>
After a print job has finished spooling to a service, this command will be
used via a system() call to process the spool file. Typically the command 
specified will submit the spool file to the host's printing subsystem, but
there is no requirement that this be the case. The server will not remove the
spool file, so whatever command you specify should remove the spool file when
it has been processed, otherwise you will need to manually remove old spool
files.<p>

The print command is simply a text string. It will be used verbatim,
with two exceptions: All occurrences of "%s" will be replaced by the
appropriate spool file name, and all occurrences of "%p" will be
replaced by the appropriate printer name. The spool file name is
generated automatically by the server, the printer name is discussed
below.<p>

The full path name will be used for the filename if %s is not preceded
by a /. If you don't like this (it can stuff up some lpq output) then
use %f instead. Any occurrences of %f get replaced by the spool
filename without the full path at the front.<p>

The print command MUST contain at least one occurrence of "%s" or %f -
the "%p" is optional. At the time a job is submitted, if no printer
name is supplied the "%p" will be silently removed from the printer
command.<p>

If specified in the [global] section, the print command given will be used
for any printable service that does not have its own print command specified.<p>

If there is neither a specified print command for a printable service nor a 
global print command, spool files will be created but not processed and (most
importantly) not removed.<p>

Note that printing may fail on some UNIXes from the "nobody"
account. If this happens then create an alternative guest account that
can print and set the "guest account" in the [global] section.<p>

You can form quite complex print commands by realising that they are
just passed to a shell. For example the following will log a print
job, print the file, then remove it. Note that ; is the usual
separator for command in shell scripts.<p>

print command = echo Printing %s >> /tmp/print.log; lpr -P %p %s; rm %s<p>

You may have to vary this command considerably depending on how you
normally print files on your system.<p>

.B Default:
	print command = lpr -r -P %p %s<p>

.B Example:
 	print command = /usr/local/samba/bin/myprintscript %p %s
<a name="print ok">
<H3>print ok (S)</H3>
See
.B printable.
<a name="printable">
<H3>printable (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'print ok'.<p>

If this parameter is 'yes', then clients may open, write to and submit spool 
files on the directory specified for the service.<p>

Note that a printable service will ALWAYS allow writing to the service path
(user privileges permitting) via the spooling of print data. The 'read only'
parameter controls only non-printing access to the resource.<p>

.B Default:
 	printable = no<p>

.B Example:
 	printable = yes<p>

<a name="printcap name">
<H3>printcap name (G)</H3>
This parameter may be used to override the compiled-in default printcap
name used by the server (usually /etc/printcap). See the discussion of the
[printers] section above for reasons why you might want to do this.<p>

On SystemV systems that use lpstat to list available printers you
can use "printcap name = lpstat" to automatically obtain lists of
available printers. This is the default for systems that define 
SYSV at compile time in Samba (this includes most SystemV based
systems). If "printcap name" is set to lpstat on these systems then
Samba will launch "lpstat -v" and attempt to parse the output to
obtain a printer list.<p>

A minimal printcap file would look something like this:<p>

print1|My Printer 1
.br
print2|My Printer 2
.br
print3|My Printer 3
.br
print4|My Printer 4
.br
print5|My Printer 5<p>

where the | separates aliases of a printer. The fact that the second
alias has a space in it gives a hint to Samba that it's a comment.<p>

NOTE: Under AIX the default printcap name is "/etc/qconfig". Samba
will assume the file is in AIX "qconfig" format if the string
"/qconfig" appears in the printcap filename.<p>

.B Default:
 	printcap name = /etc/printcap<p>

.B Example:
 	printcap name = /etc/myprintcap<p>

<a name="printer">
<H3>printer (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'printer name'.<p>

This parameter specifies the name of the printer to which print jobs spooled
through a printable service will be sent.<p>

If specified in the [global] section, the printer name given will be used
for any printable service that does not have its own printer name specified.<p>

.B Default:
 	none (but may be 'lp' on many systems)<p>

.B Example:
 	printer name = laserwriter<p>

<a name="printer driver">
<H3>printer driver (S)</H3>
This option allows you to control the string that clients receive when
they ask the server for the printer driver associated with a
printer. If you are using Windows95 or WindowsNT then you can use this
to automate the setup of printers on your system.<p>

You need to set this parameter to the exact string (case sensitive)
that describes the appropriate printer driver for your system. 
If you don't know the exact string to use then you should first try
with no "printer driver" option set and the client will give you a
list of printer drivers. The appropriate strings are shown in a
scrollbox after you have chosen the printer manufacturer.<p>

.B Example:
	printer driver = HP LaserJet 4L<p>

<a name="printer name">
<H3>printer name (S)</H3>
See
.B printer.<p>

<a name="printer driver file">
<H3>printer driver file (G)</H3>
This parameter tells Samba where the printer driver definition file,
used when serving drivers to Windows 95 clients, is to be found. If
this is not set, the default is :<p>

SAMBA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/lib/printers.def<p>

This file is created from Windows 95 'msprint.def' files found on the
Windows 95 client system. For more details on setting up serving of
printer drivers to Windows 95 clients, see the documentation file
docs/PRINTER_DRIVER.txt.<p>

.B Default:
    None (set in compile).<p>

.B Example:
    printer driver file = /usr/local/samba/printers/drivers.def<p>

Related parameters.
.B printer driver location<p>

<a name="printer driver location">
<H3>printer driver location (S)</H3>
This parameter tells clients of a particular printer share where
to find the printer driver files for the automatic installation
of drivers for Windows 95 machines. If Samba is set up to serve
printer drivers to Windows 95 machines, this should be set to<p>

\e\eMACHINE\ePRINTER$<p>

Where MACHINE is the NetBIOS name of your Samba server, and PRINTER$ 
is a share you set up for serving printer driver files. For more 
details on setting this up see the documentation file 
docs/PRINTER_DRIVER.txt.<p>

.B Default:
    None<p>

.B Example:
    printer driver location = \e\eMACHINE\ePRINTER$<p>

Related paramerers.
.B printer driver file<p>


<a name="printing">
<H3>printing (S)</H3>
This parameters controls how printer status information is interpreted
on your system, and also affects the default values for the "print
command", "lpq command" and "lprm command".<p>

Currently six printing styles are supported. They are "printing =
bsd", "printing = sysv", "printing = hpux", "printing = aix",
"printing = qnx" and "printing = plp".<p>

To see what the defaults are for the other print commands when using
these three options use the "testparm" program.<p>

As of version 1.9.18 of Samba this option can be set on a per printer basis<p>

<a name="protocol">
<H3>protocol (G)</H3>
The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level that will
be supported by the server. <p>

Possible values are CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2 and NT1. The relative
merits of each are discussed in the README file.<p>

Normally this option should not be set as the automatic negotiation
phase in the SMB protocol takes care of choosing the appropriate protocol.<p>

.B Default:
	protocol = NT1<p>

.B Example:
	protocol = LANMAN1
<a name="public">
<H3>public (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'guest ok'.<p>

If this parameter is 'yes' for a service, then no password is required
to connect to the service. Privileges will be those of the guest
account.<p>

See the section below on user/password validation for more information about
this option.<p>

.B Default:
 	public = no<p>

.B Example:
 	public = yes
<a name="read list">
<H3>read list (S)</H3>
This is a list of users that are given read-only access to a
service. If the connecting user is in this list then they will
not be given write access, no matter what the "read only" option
is set to. The list can include group names using the @group syntax.<p>

See also the "write list" option<p>

.B Default:
     read list =<p>

.B Example:
     read list = mary, @students<p>

<a name="read only">
<H3>read only (S)</H3>
See
.B writable
and
.B write ok.
Note that this is an inverted synonym for writable and write ok.
<a name="read prediction">
<H3>read prediction (G)</H3>
This options enables or disables the read prediction code used to
speed up reads from the server. When enabled the server will try to
pre-read data from the last accessed file that was opened read-only
while waiting for packets.<p>

<H3>Default:</H3>
	read prediction = False<p>

<H3>Example:</H3>
	read prediction = True
<a name="Default:</H3>
	read prediction = False<p>

<H3>Example:</H3>
	read prediction = True
<H3>read raw">
<H3>read raw (G)</H3>
This parameter controls whether or not the server will support raw reads when
transferring data to clients.<p>

If enabled, raw reads allow reads of 65535 bytes in one packet. This
typically provides a major performance benefit.<p>

However, some clients either negotiate the allowable block size incorrectly
or are incapable of supporting larger block sizes, and for these clients you
may need to disable raw reads.<p>

In general this parameter should be viewed as a system tuning tool and left
severely alone. See also
.B write raw.<p>

.B Default:
 	read raw = yes<p>

.B Example:
 	read raw = no
<a name="read size">
<H3>read size (G)</H3><p>

The option "read size" affects the overlap of disk reads/writes with
network reads/writes. If the amount of data being transferred in
several of the SMB commands (currently SMBwrite, SMBwriteX and
SMBreadbraw) is larger than this value then the server begins writing
the data before it has received the whole packet from the network, or
in the case of SMBreadbraw, it begins writing to the network before
all the data has been read from disk.<p>

This overlapping works best when the speeds of disk and network access
are similar, having very little effect when the speed of one is much
greater than the other.<p>

The default value is 2048, but very little experimentation has been
done yet to determine the optimal value, and it is likely that the best
value will vary greatly between systems anyway. A value over 65536 is
pointless and will cause you to allocate memory unnecessarily.<p>

.B Default:
	read size = 2048<p>

.B Example:
	read size = 8192<p>

<a name="remote announce">
<H3>remote announce (G)</H3><p>

This option allows you to setup nmbd to periodically announce itself
to arbitrary IP addresses with an arbitrary workgroup name. <p>

This is useful if you want your Samba server to appear in a remote
workgroup for which the normal browse propagation rules don't
work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you can send IP
packets to.<p>

For example:<p>

       remote announce = 192.168.2.255/SERVERS 192.168.4.255/STAFF<p>

the above line would cause nmbd to announce itself to the two given IP
addresses using the given workgroup names. If you leave out the
workgroup name then the one given in the "workgroup" option is used
instead. <p>

The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast addresses
of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses of known
browse masters if your network config is that stable.<p>

This option replaces similar functionality from the nmbd lmhosts file.<p>

<a name="remote browse sync">
<H3>remote browse sync (G)</H3><p>

This option allows you to setup nmbd to periodically request synchronisation
of browse lists with the master browser of a samba server that is on a remote
segment. This option will allow you to gain browse lists for multiple
workgroups across routed networks. This is done in a manner that does not work
with any non-samba servers.<p>

This is useful if you want your Samba server and all local clients
to appear in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse propagation
rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you can send IP
packets to.<p>

For example:<p>

       remote browse sync = 192.168.2.255 192.168.4.255<p>

the above line would cause nmbd to request the master browser on the
specified subnets or addresses to synchronise their browse lists with
the local server.<p>

The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast addresses
of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses of known
browse masters if your network config is that stable. If a machine IP
address is given Samba makes NO attempt to validate that the remote
machine is available, is listening, nor that it is in fact the browse
master on it's segment.<p>


<a name="revalidate">
<H3>revalidate (S)</H3><p>

This options controls whether Samba will allow a previously validated
username/password pair to be used to attach to a share. Thus if you
connect to \e\eserver\eshare1 then to \e\eserver\eshare2 it won't
automatically allow the client to request connection to the second
share as the same username as the first without a password.<p>

If "revalidate" is True then the client will be denied automatic
access as the same username.<p>

.B Default:
	revalidate = False<p>

.B Example:
	revalidate = True<p>

<a name="root">
<H3>root (G)</H3>
See
.B root directory.
<a name="root dir">
<H3>root dir (G)</H3>
See
.B root directory.
<a name="root directory">
<H3>root directory (G)</H3>
Synonyms for this parameter are 'root dir' and 'root'.<p>

The server will chroot() to this directory on startup. This is not 
strictly necessary for secure operation. Even without it the server
will deny access to files not in one of the service entries. It may 
also check for, and deny access to, soft links to other parts of the 
filesystem, or attempts to use .. in file names to access other 
directories (depending on the setting of the "wide links" parameter).<p>

Adding a "root dir" entry other than "/" adds an extra level of security, 
but at a price. It absolutely ensures that no access is given to files not
in the sub-tree specified in the "root dir" option, *including* some files 
needed for complete operation of the server. To maintain full operability
of the server you will need to mirror some system files into the "root dir"
tree. In particular you will need to mirror /etc/passwd (or a subset of it),
and any binaries or configuration files needed for printing (if required). 
The set of files that must be mirrored is operating system dependent.<p>

.B Default:
 	root directory = /<p>

.B Example:
 	root directory = /homes/smb
<a name="root postexec">
<H3>root postexec (S)</H3><p>

This is the same as postexec except that the command is run as
root. This is useful for unmounting filesystems (such as cdroms) after
a connection is closed.<p>

<a name="root preexec">
<H3>root preexec (S)</H3><p>

This is the same as preexec except that the command is run as
root. This is useful for mounting filesystems (such as cdroms) before
a connection is finalised.<p>

<a name="security">
<H3>security (G)</H3>
This option affects how clients respond to Samba.<p>

The option sets the "security mode bit" in replies to protocol negotiations
to turn share level security on or off. Clients decide based on this bit 
whether (and how) to transfer user and password information to the server.<p>

The default is "security=SHARE", mainly because that was the only
option at one stage.<p>

The alternatives are "security = user" or "security = server". <p>

If your PCs use usernames that are the same as their usernames on the
UNIX machine then you will want to use "security = user". If you
mostly use usernames that don't exist on the UNIX box then use
"security = share".<p>

There is a bug in WfWg that may affect your decision. When in user
level security a WfWg client will totally ignore the password you type
in the "connect drive" dialog box. This makes it very difficult (if
not impossible) to connect to a Samba service as anyone except the
user that you are logged into WfWg as.<p>

If you use "security = server" then Samba will try to validate the
username/password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT
box. If this fails it will revert to "security = USER".<p>

See the "password server" option for more details.<p>

.B Default:
 	security = SHARE<p>

.B Example:
 	security = USER
<a name="server string">
<H3>server string (G)</H3>
This controls what string will show up in the printer comment box in
print manager and next to the IPC connection in "net view". It can be
any string that you wish to show to your users.<p>

It also sets what will appear in browse lists next to the machine name.<p>

A %v will be replaced with the Samba version number.<p>

A %h will be replaced with the hostname.<p>

.B Default:
	server string = Samba %v<p>

.B Example:
	server string = University of GNUs Samba Server<p>

<a name="set directory">
<H3>set directory (S)</H3>
If 'set directory = no', then users of the service may not use the setdir
command to change directory.<p>

The setdir command is only implemented in the Digital Pathworks client. See the
Pathworks documentation for details.<p>

.B Default:
 	set directory = no<p>

.B Example:
 	set directory = yes<p>

<a name="shared file entries">
<H3>shared file entries (G)</H3>
This parameter has been removed (as of Samba 1.9.18 and above). The new
System V shared memory code prohibits the user from allocating the
share hash bucket size directly.<p>

<a name="shared mem size">
<H3>shared mem size (G)</H3>
This parameter is only useful when Samba has been compiled with FAST_SHARE_MODES.
It specifies the size of the shared memory (in bytes) to use between smbd 
processes. You should never change this parameter unless you have studied 
the source and know what you are doing. This parameter defaults to 1024
multiplied by the setting of the maximum number of open files in the
file local.h in the Samba source code. MAX_OPEN_FILES is normally set
to 100, so this parameter defaults to 102400 bytes.<p>

.B Default
	shared mem size = 102400<p>

<a name="smb passwd file">
<H3>smb passwd file (G)</H3>
This option sets the path to the encrypted smbpasswd file. This is a *VERY
DANGEROUS OPTION* if the smb.conf is user writable. By default the path
to the smbpasswd file is compiled into Samba.<p>

<a name="smbrun">
<H3>smbrun (G)</H3>
This sets the full path to the smbrun binary. This defaults to the
value in the Makefile.<p>

You must get this path right for many services to work correctly.<p>

.B Default:
taken from Makefile<p>

.B Example:
	smbrun = /usr/local/samba/bin/smbrun<p>

<a name="share modes">
<H3>share modes (S)</H3><p>

This enables or disables the honouring of the "share modes" during a
file open. These modes are used by clients to gain exclusive read or
write access to a file. <p>

These open modes are not directly supported by UNIX, so they are
simulated using lock files in the "lock directory". The "lock
directory" specified in smb.conf must be readable by all users.<p>

The share modes that are enabled by this option are DENY_DOS,
DENY_ALL, DENY_READ, DENY_WRITE, DENY_NONE and DENY_FCB.<p>

Enabling this option gives full share compatibility but may cost a bit
of processing time on the UNIX server. They are enabled by default.<p>

.B Default:
	share modes = yes<p>

.B Example:
	share modes = no<p>

<a name="short preserve case">
<H3>short preserve case (S)</H3><p>

This controls if new short filenames are created with the case that
the client passes, or if they are forced to be the "default" case.<p>

.B Default:
       short preserve case = no<p>

See the section on "NAME MANGLING" for a fuller discussion.<p>

<a name="socket address">
<H3>socket address (G)</H3><p>

This option allows you to control what address Samba will listen for
connections on. This is used to support multiple virtual interfaces on
the one server, each with a different configuration.<p>

By default samba will accept connections on any address.<p>

.B Example:
	socket address = 192.168.2.20<p>

<a name="socket options">
<H3>socket options (G)</H3>
This option (which can also be invoked with the -O command line
option) allows you to set socket options to be used when talking with
the client.<p>

Socket options are controls on the networking layer of the operating
systems which allow the connection to be tuned.<p>

This option will typically be used to tune your Samba server for
optimal performance for your local network. There is no way that Samba
can know what the optimal parameters are for your net, so you must
experiment and choose them yourself. I strongly suggest you read the
appropriate documentation for your operating system first (perhaps
"man setsockopt" will help).<p>

You may find that on some systems Samba will say "Unknown socket
option" when you supply an option. This means you either mis-typed it
or you need to add an include file to includes.h for your OS. If the
latter is the case please send the patch to me
(samba-bugs@samba.anu.edu.au).<p>

Any of the supported socket options may be combined in any way you
like, as long as your OS allows it.<p>

This is the list of socket options currently settable using this
option:<p>

  SO_KEEPALIVE<p>

  SO_REUSEADDR<p>

  SO_BROADCAST<p>

  TCP_NODELAY<p>

  IPTOS_LOWDELAY<p>

  IPTOS_THROUGHPUT<p>

  SO_SNDBUF *<p>

  SO_RCVBUF *<p>

  SO_SNDLOWAT *<p>

  SO_RCVLOWAT *<p>

Those marked with a * take an integer argument. The others can
optionally take a 1 or 0 argument to enable or disable the option, by
default they will be enabled if you don't specify 1 or 0.<p>

To specify an argument use the syntax SOME_OPTION=VALUE for example
SO_SNDBUF=8192. Note that you must not have any spaces before or after
the = sign.<p>

If you are on a local network then a sensible option might be<p>

socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY<p>

If you have an almost unloaded local network and you don't mind a lot
of extra CPU usage in the server then you could try<p>

socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY<p>

If you are on a wide area network then perhaps try setting
IPTOS_THROUGHPUT. <p>

Note that several of the options may cause your Samba server to fail
completely. Use these options with caution!<p>

.B Default:
	no socket options<p>

.B Example:
	socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY	<p>

<p>


<a name="status">
<H3>status (G)</H3>
This enables or disables logging of connections to a status file that
.B smbstatus
can read.<p>

With this disabled
.B smbstatus
won't be able to tell you what
connections are active.<p>

.B Default:
	status = yes<p>

.B Example:
	status = no<p>

<a name="strict locking">
<H3>strict locking (S)</H3>
This is a boolean that controls the handling of file locking in the
server. When this is set to yes the server will check every read and
write access for file locks, and deny access if locks exist. This can
be slow on some systems.<p>

When strict locking is "no" the server does file lock checks only when
the client explicitly asks for them. <p>

Well behaved clients always ask for lock checks when it is important,
so in the vast majority of cases "strict locking = no" is preferable.<p>

.B Default:
	strict locking = no<p>

.B Example:
	strict locking = yes<p>

<a name="strip dot">
<H3>strip dot (G)</H3>
This is a boolean that controls whether to strip trailing dots off
UNIX filenames. This helps with some CDROMs that have filenames ending in a
single dot.<p>

.B Default:
	strip dot = no<p>

.B Example:
    strip dot = yes<p>

<a name="syslog">
<H3>syslog (G)</H3>
This parameter maps how Samba debug messages are logged onto the
system syslog logging levels. Samba debug level zero maps onto
syslog LOG_ERR, debug level one maps onto LOG_WARNING, debug
level two maps to LOG_NOTICE, debug level three maps onto LOG_INFO.
The paramter sets the threshold for doing the mapping, all Samba
debug messages above this threashold are mapped to syslog LOG_DEBUG
messages.<p>

.B Default:<p>

	syslog = 1<p>

<a name="syslog only">
<H3>syslog only (G)</H3>
If this parameter is set then Samba debug messages are logged into
the system syslog only, and not to the debug log files.<p>

.B Default:
	syslog only = no<p>

<a name="sync always">
<H3>sync always (S)</H3><p>

This is a boolean parameter that controls whether writes will always
be written to stable storage before the write call returns. If this is
false then the server will be guided by the client's request in each
write call (clients can set a bit indicating that a particular write
should be synchronous). If this is true then every write will be
followed by a fsync() call to ensure the data is written to disk.<p>

.B Default:
	sync always = no<p>

.B Example:
	sync always = yes<p>

<a name="time offset">
<H3>time offset (G)</H3>
This parameter is a setting in minutes to add to the normal GMT to
local time conversion. This is useful if you are serving a lot of PCs
that have incorrect daylight saving time handling.<p>

.B Default:
	time offset = 0<p>

.B Example:
	time offset = 60<p>

<a name="time server">
<H3>time server (G)</H3>
This parameter determines if nmbd advertises itself as a time server
to Windows clients. The default is False.<p>

.B Default:
	time server = False<p>

.B Example:
	time server = True<p>

<a name="unix realname">
<H3>unix realname (G)</H3>
This boolean parameter when set causes samba to supply the real name field
from the unix password file to the client. This is useful for setting up
mail clients and WWW browsers on systems used by more than one person.<p>

.B Default:
	unix realname = no<p>

.B Example:
	unix realname = yes<p>

<a name="user">
<H3>user (S)</H3>
See
.B username.
<a name="username">
<H3>username (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'user'.<p>

Multiple users may be specified in a comma-delimited list, in which case the
supplied password will be tested against each username in turn (left to right).<p>

The username= line is needed only when the PC is unable to supply its own
username. This is the case for the coreplus protocol or where your
users have different WfWg usernames to UNIX usernames. In both these
cases you may also be better using the \e\eserver\eshare%user syntax
instead. <p>

The username= line is not a great solution in many cases as it means Samba
will try to validate the supplied password against each of the
usernames in the username= line in turn. This is slow and a bad idea for
lots of users in case of duplicate passwords. You may get timeouts or
security breaches using this parameter unwisely.<p>

Samba relies on the underlying UNIX security. This parameter does not
restrict who can login, it just offers hints to the Samba server as to
what usernames might correspond to the supplied password. Users can
login as whoever they please and they will be able to do no more
damage than if they started a telnet session. The daemon runs as the
user that they log in as, so they cannot do anything that user cannot
do.<p>

To restrict a service to a particular set of users you can use the
"valid users=" line.<p>

If any of the usernames begin with a @ then the name will be looked up
in the groups file and will expand to a list of all users in the group
of that name. Note that searching though a groups file can take quite
some time, and some clients may time out during the search.<p>

See the section below on username/password validation for more information
on how this parameter determines access to the services.<p>

.B Default:
 	The guest account if a guest service, else the name of the service.<p>

.B Examples:
 	username = fred
 	username = fred, mary, jack, jane, @users, @pcgroup<p>

<a name="username level">
<H3>username level (G)</H3><p>

This option helps Samba to try and 'guess' at the real UNIX username,
as many DOS clients send an all-uppercase username. By default Samba
tries all lowercase, followed by the username with the first letter
capitalized, and fails if the username is not found on the UNIX machine.<p>

If this parameter is set to non-zero the behaviour changes. This 
parameter is a number that specifies the number of uppercase combinations 
to try whilst trying to determine the UNIX user name. The higher the number
the more combinations will be tried, but the slower the discovery
of usernames will be. Use this parameter when you have strange
usernames on your UNIX machine, such as 'AstrangeUser'.<p>

.B Default:
    username level = 0<p>

.B Example:
    username level = 5<p>

<a name="username map">
<H3>username map (G)</H3><p>

This option allows you to to specify a file containing a mapping of
usernames from the clients to the server. This can be used for several
purposes. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or
Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses. The other is to map
multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share
files.<p>

The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should contain a single
UNIX username on the left then a '=' followed by a list of usernames
on the right. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of
the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in
that group. The special client name '*' is a wildcard and matches any
name.<p>

The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and
comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the '='
signs. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right
hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left. Processing
then continues with the next line.<p>

If any line begins with a '#' or a ';' then it is ignored<p>

If any line begins with an ! then the processing will stop after that
line if a mapping was done by the line. Otherwise mapping continues
with every line being processed. Using ! is most useful when you have
a wildcard mapping line later in the file.<p>

For example to map from the name "admin" or "administrator" to the UNIX
name "root" you would use<p>

	root = admin administrator<p>

Or to map anyone in the UNIX group "system" to the UNIX name "sys" you
would use<p>

	sys = @system<p>

You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file.<p>

You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double
quotes around the name. For example:<p>

	tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"<p>

would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username
tridge.<p>

The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys,
and map the rest to guest. Note the use of the ! to tell Samba to stop
processing if it gets a match on that line.<p>

	!sys = mary fred
	guest = *<p>


Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of
usernames. Thus if you connect to "\e\eserver\efred" and "fred" is
remapped to "mary" then you will actually be connecting to
"\e\eserver\emary" and will need to supply a password suitable for
"mary" not "fred". The only exception to this is the username passed
to the "password server" (if you have one). The password server will
receive whatever username the client supplies without modification.<p>

Also note that no reverse mapping is done. The main effect this has is
with printing. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting
print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don't own the
print job.<p>

.B Default
	no username map<p>

.B Example
	username map = /usr/local/samba/lib/users.map<p>

<a name="valid chars">
<H3>valid chars (S)</H3><p>

The option allows you to specify additional characters that should be
considered valid by the server in filenames. This is particularly
useful for national character sets, such as adding u-umlaut or a-ring.<p>

The option takes a list of characters in either integer or character
form with spaces between them. If you give two characters with a colon
between them then it will be taken as an lowercase:uppercase pair.<p>

If you have an editor capable of entering the characters into the
config file then it is probably easiest to use this method. Otherwise
you can specify the characters in octal, decimal or hexadecimal form
using the usual C notation.<p>

For example to add the single character 'Z' to the charset (which is a
pointless thing to do as it's already there) you could do one of the
following<p>

valid chars = Z
valid chars = z:Z
valid chars = 0132:0172<p>

The last two examples above actually add two characters, and alter
the uppercase and lowercase mappings appropriately.<p>

Note that you MUST specify this parameter after the "client code page"
parameter if you have both set. If "client code page" is set after
the "valid chars" parameter the "valid chars" settings will be
overwritten.<p>

See also the "client code page" parameter.<p>

.B Default
.br
	Samba defaults to using a reasonable set of valid characters
.br
	for english systems<p>

.B Example
        valid chars = 0345:0305 0366:0326 0344:0304<p>

The above example allows filenames to have the swedish characters in
them. <p>

NOTE: It is actually quite difficult to correctly produce a "valid
chars" line for a particular system. To automate the process
tino@augsburg.net has written a package called "validchars" which will
automatically produce a complete "valid chars" line for a given client
system. Look in the examples subdirectory for this package.<p>

<a name="valid users">
<H3>valid users (S)</H3>
This is a list of users that should be allowed to login to this
service. A name starting with @ is interpreted as a UNIX group.<p>

If this is empty (the default) then any user can login. If a username
is in both this list and the "invalid users" list then access is
denied for that user.<p>

The current servicename is substituted for %S. This is useful in the
[homes] section.<p>

See also "invalid users"<p>

.B Default
	No valid users list. (anyone can login)<p>

.B Example
	valid users = greg, @pcusers<p>


<a name="veto file">
<H3>veto files(S)</H3>
This is a list of files and directories that are neither visible nor
accessible.  Each entry in the list must be separated by a "/", which
allows spaces to be included in the entry.  '*' and '?' can be used to
specify multiple files or directories as in DOS wildcards.<p>

Each entry must be a unix path, not a DOS path and must not include the 
unix directory separator "/".<p>

Note that the case sensitivity option is applicable in vetoing files.<p>

One feature of the veto files parameter that it is important to be
aware of, is that if a directory contains nothing but files that
match the veto files parameter (which means that Windows/DOS clients
cannot ever see them) is deleted, the veto files within that directory
*are automatically deleted* along with it, if the user has UNIX permissions
to do so.
 
Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, as
it will be forced to check all files and directories for a match
as they are scanned.<p>

See also "hide files" and "case sensitive"<p>

.B Default
	No files or directories are vetoed.<p>

.B Examples
    Example 1.
    Veto any files containing the word Security, 
    any ending in .tmp, and any directory containing the
    word root.<p>

	veto files = /*Security*/*.tmp/*root*/<p>

    Example 2.
    Veto the Apple specific files that a NetAtalk server
    creates.<p>

    veto files = /.AppleDouble/.bin/.AppleDesktop/Network Trash Folder/<p>

<a name="veto oplock files">
<H3>veto oplock files (S)</H3>
This parameter is only valid when the 'oplocks' parameter is turned on
for a share. It allows the Samba administrator to selectively turn off
the granting of oplocks on selected files that match a wildcarded list,
similar to the wildcarded list used in the 'veto files' parameter.<p>

.B Default
    No files are vetoed for oplock grants.<p>

.B Examples
You might want to do this on files that you know will be heavily
contended for by clients. A good example of this is in the NetBench
SMB benchmark program, which causes heavy client contention for files
ending in .SEM. To cause Samba not to grant oplocks on these files
you would use the line (either in the [global] section or in the section
for the particular NetBench share :<p>

     veto oplock files = /*.SEM/<p>

<a name="volume">
<H3>volume (S)</H3>
This allows you to override the volume label returned for a
share. Useful for CDROMs with installation programs that insist on a
particular volume label.<p>

The default is the name of the share<p>

<a name="wide links">
<H3>wide links (S)</H3>
This parameter controls whether or not links in the UNIX file system may be
followed by the server. Links that point to areas within the directory tree
exported by the server are always allowed; this parameter controls access 
only to areas that are outside the directory tree being exported.<p>

.B Default:
 	wide links = yes<p>

.B Example:
 	wide links = no<p>

<a name="wins proxy">
<H3>wins proxy (G)</H3><p>

This is a boolean that controls if nmbd will respond to broadcast name
queries on behalf of other hosts. You may need to set this to no for
some older clients.<p>

.B Default:
	wins proxy = no
<a name="wins server">
<H3>wins server (G)</H3><p>

This specifies the DNS name (or IP address) of the WINS server that Samba 
should register with. If you have a WINS server on your network then you
should set this to the WINS servers name.<p>

You should point this at your WINS server if you have a multi-subnetted
network.
.B Default:
	wins server = <p>

<a name="wins support">
<H3>wins support (G)</H3><p>

This boolean controls if the nmbd process in Samba will act as a WINS server. 
You should not set this to true unless you have a multi-subnetted network and
you wish a particular nmbd to be your WINS server. Note that you
should *NEVER* set this to true on more than one machine in your
network.<p>

.B Default:
	wins support = no<p>

<a name="workgroup">
<H3>workgroup (G)</H3><p>

This controls what workgroup your server will appear to be in when
queried by clients. <p>

.B Default:
 	set in the Makefile<p>

.B Example:
 	workgroup = MYGROUP<p>

<a name="writable">
<H3>writable (S)</H3>
A synonym for this parameter is 'write ok'. An inverted synonym is 'read only'.<p>

If this parameter is 'no', then users of a service may not create or modify
files in the service's directory.<p>

Note that a printable service ('printable = yes') will ALWAYS allow 
writing to the directory (user privileges permitting), but only via
spooling operations.<p>

.B Default:
 	writable = no<p>

.B Examples:
 	read only = no
 	writable = yes
 	write ok = yes
<a name="write list">
<H3>write list (S)</H3>
This is a list of users that are given read-write access to a
service. If the connecting user is in this list then they will be
given write access, no matter what the "read only" option is set
to. The list can include group names using the @group syntax.<p>

Note that if a user is in both the read list and the write list then
they will be given write access.<p>

See also the "read list" option<p>

.B Default:
     write list =<p>

.B Example:
     write list = admin, root, @staff<p>

<a name="write ok">
<H3>write ok (S)</H3>
See
.B writable
and
.B read only.<p>

<a name="write raw">
<H3>write raw (G)</H3>
This parameter controls whether or not the server will support raw writes when
transferring data from clients.<p>

.B Default:
 	write raw = yes<p>

.B Example:
 	write raw = no<p>
