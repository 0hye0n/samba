Configuration file for Kerberos 5
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
file specifies several configuration parameters for the Kerberos 5
library, as well as some programs.
.Pp
The file consists of one or more sections, containing a number of
bindings. The value of each binding can be either a string or a list
of other bindings. The grammar looks like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
file:
	/* empty */
	sections

sections:
	section sections
	section

section:
	'[' section_name ']' bindings

section_name:
	STRING

bindings:
	binding bindings
	binding

binding:
	name '=' STRING
	name '=' '{' bindings '}'

name:
	STRING

.Ed
.Li STRINGs
consists of one or more non-white space characters.
Currently recognised sections and bindings are:

.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxx" -offset indent
.It Li libdefaults
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxx" -offset indent
.It Li default_realm = Va REALM
Default realm to use, this is also known as your 
.Dq local realm .
The default is the result of
.Fn krb5_get_host_realm "local host name" .
.It Li clockskew = time
Maximum time differential (in seconds) allowed when comparing
times. Default is 300 seconds (five minutes).
.It Li kdc_timeout = time
Maximum time to wait for a reply from the kdc, default is 3 seconds.
.El
.It Li domain_realm
This is a list of mappings from DNS domain to Kerberos realm. Each
binding in this section looks like:
.Pp
.Dl domain = realm
.Pp
The domain can be either a full name of a host or a trailing
component, in the latter case the domain-string should start with a
perid.
.It Li realms
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Va REALM Li = {
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Li kdc = Va host[:port]
Specifies a kdc for this realm. If the optional port is absent, the
default value for the
.Dq kerberos/udp
service will be used.
.It Li v4_instance_convert = {
This specifies a list of version 4 instance to version 5 component
conversions that should be made when converting a version 4 principal
to a version 5 ditto. Since version 4 host instances only contains the
first part of the domain name, this section is sometimes
necessary. See also
.Li default_domain .
.It }
.It Li v4_name_convert = {
Similar to
.Li v4_instance_convert ,
but converts the version 4 name, rather than the instance. This is not
used by the MIT libkrb5, but before someone thinks up something better
you will have to have a binding looking like:
.Pp
.Dl rcmd = host
.Pp
here.
.It }
.It Li default_domain = Va domain
The default domain to use when converting version 4 instances to
version 5 principals.
.El
.It Li }
