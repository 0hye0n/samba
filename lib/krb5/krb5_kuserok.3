that file does not exist, all principals with a first component
identical to the username, and a realm considered local, are allowed
access.
.Pp
The
.Pa .k5login
file must contain one principal per line, be owned by
.Fa user ,
and not be writable by group or other.
.Pp
Note that if the file exists, no implicit access rights are given to
.Fa user Ns @ Ns Aq localrealm .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns
.Dv TRUE
if access should be granted,
.Dv FALSE
otherwise.
