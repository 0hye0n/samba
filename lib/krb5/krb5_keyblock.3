.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Li krb5_keyblock
holds the encryption key for a specific encryption type.
There is no component inside
.Li krb5_keyblock
that is directly referable.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_keyblock_get_enctype
returns the encryption type of the keyblock.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_copy_keyblock
makes a copy the keyblock
.Fa inblock
to the
output
.Fa out .
.Fa out
should be freed by the caller with
.Fa krb5_free_keyblock .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_copy_keyblock_contents
copies the contents of
.Fa inblock
to the
.Fa to
keyblock.
The destination keyblock is overritten.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_keyblock
free the content and the keyblock itself.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_keyblock_contents
frees the content of the keyblock.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_generate_random_keyblock
creates a new content of the keyblock
.Fa key
of type encrytion type
.Fa type .
The content of
.Fa key
is overwritten and not freed, so the caller should be sure it is
freed before calling the function.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_keyblock_zero
zeros out the keyblock to to make sure no keymaterial is in
memory.
Note that
.Fn krb5_free_keyblock_contents
also zeros out the memory.
