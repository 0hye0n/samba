.Sh NAME
.Nm krb5_init_context ,
.Nm krb5_free_context ,
.Nm krb5_add_et_list
.Nd create, modify and delete krb5_context structures
.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_init_context "krb5_context *context"
.Ft void
.Fn krb5_free_context "krb5_context context"
.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_add_et_list "krb5_context context" "void (*func)(struct et_list **)"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn krb5_init_context
function initializes the
.Fa context
structure and reads the configuration file
.Pa /etc/krb5.conf .
.Pp
The structure should be freed by calling
.Fn krb5_free_context
when it is no longer being used.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_init_context
returns 0 to indicate success.
Otherwise an errno code is returned.
Failure means either that something bad happened during initialization
(typically
.Bq ENOMEM )
or that Kerberos should not be used
.Bq ENXIO .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_add_et_list 
adds a
.Xr com_err 3
error-code handler
.Fa func
to the specified
.Fa context .
The error handler must generated by the the re-rentrant version of the
.Xr compile_et 3
program.
