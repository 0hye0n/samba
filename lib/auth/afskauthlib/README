This is an attempt at a module compatible with transarcs
afskauthlib.so.  It should be usable on all systems where the standard
programs use this library.  At least the programs on SGIs do.

It seems that you currently have to copy libkafs.so, libkrb.so, and
libdes.so to /usr/lib, or build your afskauthlib.so statically.

The afskauthlib.so itself is able to reside in /usr/vice/etc,
/usr/afsws/lib, or the current directory (wherever that is).
