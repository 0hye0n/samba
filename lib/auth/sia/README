This is a quick attempt at a SIA module for Kerberos. To install this
you will have to do the following:

* Make sure libsia_krb4.so is available in /usr/athena/lib. You might
  actually want it on local disk, so /usr/shlib might be a better
  place if /usr/athena is not local.

* Copy krb4_matrix.conf to /etc/sia. If you put libsia_krb4.so in some
  obscure place, you might have to edit krb4_matrix.conf.

* Apply security.patch to /sbin/init.d/security

* Turn on krb4 security by issuing `rcmgr set SECURITY KRB4' and
  `rcmgr set KRB4_MATRIX_CONF krb4_matrix.conf'

* Digital thinks you should reboot your machine, but that really
  shouldn't be necessary.  It's usually sufficient just to run
  /sbin/init.d/security

Users with local passwords (like root) should be able to login safely.

When using Digital's xdm the KRBTKFILE environment variable doesn't
get passed along (since xdm zaps the environment). Instead you have to
set KRBTKFILE to the correct value in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession. Add a
line similar to

KRBTKFILE=/tmp/tkt`id -u`_`ps -o ppid= -p $$`

Also remember to export this variable.


There is currently no support for changing kerberos passwords. Use
kpasswd instead.
