This is a quick attempt at a SIA module for Kerberos. To install this
you will have to do the following:

* Make sure libsia_krb4.so is available in /usr/athena/lib. You might
  actually want it on local disk, so /usr/shlib might be a better
  place if /usr/athena is not local.

* Copy krb4_matrix.conf to /etc/sia. If you put libsia_krb4.so in some
  obscure place, you might have to edit krb4_matrix.conf.

* Apply security.patch to /sbin/init.d/security

* Turn on krb4 security by issuing `rcmgr set SECURITY KRB4' and
  `rcmgr set KRB4_MATRIX_CONF krb4_matrix.conf'

* Digital thinks you should reboot your machine, but that really
  shouldn't be necessary.  It's usually sufficient just to run
  /sbin/init.d/security

Users with local passwords (like root) should be able to login safely.

There is currently no support for changing kerberos passwords. Use
kpasswd instead.
