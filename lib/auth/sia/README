This is a quick attempt at a SIA module for Kerberos. To install this
you will have to do the following:

* Make sure libsia_krb4.so is available in /usr/athena/lib

* Copy krb4_matrix.conf to /etc/sia

* Apply security.patch to /sbin/init.d/security

* Turn on krb4 security by issuing `rcmgr set SECURITY KRB4' and
  `rcmgr set KRB4_MATRIX_CONF krb4_matrix.conf'

* Digital thinks you should reboot your machine, but that really
  shouldn't be necessary.  It's usually sufficient just to run
  /sbin/init.d/security


Users with local passwords (like root) should be able to login safely.
