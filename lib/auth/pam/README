This is a quick attempt at a PAM module for Kerberos. You don't really
want to use this, but if you feel suicidal you will have to do the
following:

* Make sure pam_krb4.so is available in /usr/athena/lib. You might
  actually want it on local disk, so /lib/security might be a better
  place if /usr/athena is not local.

* Look at pam.conf.add for examples of what to add to /etc/pam.conf

There is currently no support for changing kerberos passwords. Use
kpasswd instead.


See also Derrick J Brashear's <shadow@dementia.org> Kerberos PAM
module at ftp://ftp.dementia.org/pub/pam. It has a lot more features,
and is more in line with other PAM modules.
