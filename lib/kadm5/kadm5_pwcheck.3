.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions preforms that quality check for the heimdal database
library.
.Pp
Two versions of the shared object API, old version (0) deprecated, but
supported still supported.  New version (1) support multiple password
quality checking modules in the same shared object.
.Pp
In case a password doesn't pass the password quality check, the
.Fn kadm5_verify_password_quality
returns a more version description of the error in the krb5_context,
you can get the error with
.Fn krb5_get_error_string .
.Pp
The password quality checker will run over all tests that is
configured by the user.
.Pp
Modules names are on the form
.Ql vendor:test-name ,
or if the the test name is unique enough, just
.Ql test-name .
.Sh IMPLEMENTING A PASSWORD QUALITY CHECKING SHARED OBJECT
The object needs to provide a entry point called
.Ql kadm5_password_verifier
of the type
.Ft "struct kadm5_pw_policy_verifier" .
.Pp
.Ft name 
and
.Ft vendor
is filled in with the obvious information and
.Ft version
is set to
.Dv KADM5_PASSWD_VERSION_V1 .
The
.Ft type
contains a array of
.Ft "struct kadm5_pw_policy_check_func"
structures that is terminated with a entry where the
.Ft name
component is
.Dv NULL .
