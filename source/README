Samba, The Next Generation.
Sun Jan 2nd 2000.
lkcl, samba team.

if you got this far, you probably obtained samba using cvs.  well done.
in order to maintain it, you will need to use cvs update, but occasionally
this will fail, and you will need to delete your cvs tree and start again.
instructions, in case it was a while since you last did that, are at
http://samba.org/cvs.html.  remember to use SAMBA_TNG as the tag name.

compilation and usage instructions.  the following are executed at the unix
prompt, if you hadn't already guessed.

./configure
make
[make install]

to run samba, you will need:

bin/smbd
bin/nmbd

if you are using any nt clients, running the following will change the
behaviour of the nt clients towards samba, which will improve the nt
clients' reliability and performance:

bin/srvsvcd
bin/wkssvcd

if you intend to operate samba with "encrypt passwords = yes", you will
also need:

bin/lsarpcd
bin/samrd
bin/netlogond
bin/winregd

if you need NT-style printing:

bin/spoolssd

if you want to be able to start/stop services remotely (yes, dammit,
you can only do this as root, you think i'm stupid????), you will need,
as well as your own rc.services script in /usr/local/samba/bin:

bin/svcctld


i _really_ like this daemon architecture stuff.  if ever there's a problem,
or you want to upgrade one component, just kill the relevant daemon,
NOT smbd and NOT any of the other services, and restart it.  i think
that's just great :)
