This is a prelodable shared library that provides SMB client services
for existing executables. Using this you can simulate a smb
filesystem.

Currently this code has only been tested on:

- Linux 2.0 with glibc2 (RH5.1)
- Linux 2.1 with glibc2
- Solaris 2.5.1 with gcc
- Solaris 2.6 with gcc
- SunOS 4.1.3 with gcc
- IRIX 6.4 with cc

It probably won't run on other systems without some porting.

To use it you need to do this:

1) build smbwrapper.so using the command "make smbwrapper"
3) run smbsh

You will be asked for a username and password. After that you will be
returned to a shell prompt. It is actually a subshell running with
smbwrapper enabled. You can confirm this by checking if the SMBW_USER
environment variable is defined.

Now try to access /smb/SERVER for some SMB server name and see what
happens. If you set SMBW_WORKGROUP to your workgroup or have workgroup
set in yoru smb.conf then listing /smb/ should list all SMB servers in
your workgroup.

For debugging you can set SMBW_DEBUG to an integer debug level.

This is code under development. Lots of things don't work yet.

Things that I have tried and do seem to work include:

  emacs, tar, ls, cmp, cp, rsync, du, cat, rm, mv, less, more, wc, head,
  tail, bash, tcsh, mkdir, rmdir, vim, xedit, diff

things that I know don't work:
 
 anything executing from the share
 anything that uses mmap
 redirection within shells to smbsh files

If you want to help with the development of this code then join the
