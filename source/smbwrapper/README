This is a prelodable shared library that provides SMB client services
for existing executables. Using this you can simulate a smb
filesystem.

Currently this code has only been tested on:

- Linux 2.0 with glibc2 (RH5.1)
- Linux 2.1 with glibc2
- Solaris 2.5 with gcc
- Solaris 2.5.1 with gcc
- Solaris 2.6 with gcc

It probably won't run on other systems without some porting.

To use it you need to do this:

1) build smbwrapper.so using the command "make smbwrapper"
3) run smbsh

then try to access /smb/SERVER for some SMB server name and see what
happens.

For debugging you can set SMBW_DEBUG to an integer debug level.

This is code under development. Lots of things don't work yet.

Things that I have tried and do seem to work include:

  emacs, tar, ls, cmp, cp, rsync, du, cat, rm, mv, less, more, wc, head,
  tail, bash, tcsh, mkdir, rmdir, vim, xedit, diff

things that I know don't work:
 
 anything executing from the share
 anything that uses mmap
 redirection within shells to smbsh files
