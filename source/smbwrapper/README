This is a prelodable shared library that provides SMB client services
for existing executables. Using this you can simulate a smb
filesystem.

Currently this code only works on Linux with glibc2 (tested on
RH5.1). Eventually I hope to make it portable to lots of OSes but at
the moment if you don't have Linux then don't even try to use it.

To use it you need to do this:

1) build smbwrapper.so using the command "make smbwrapper/smbwrapper.so"
2) edit smbsh and set the LIBDIR line to point to the smbwrapper directory
3) run smbsh

then try to access /smb/SERVER for some SMB server name and see what
happens.

For debugging you can set SMBW_DEBUG to an integer debug level.

This is code under development. Lots of things don't work yet.

Things that I have tried and do seem to work include:

  emacs, tar, ls, cmp, cp, rsync, du, cat, rm, mv, less, more, wc, head,
  tail, bash, tcsh

things that I know don't work:
 
 vi (I don't know why this is)
 anything executing from the share
 anything that uses mmap
