README for Samba SWIG Python extensions
---------------------------------------

Instructions for building:

1. Run configure with the --with-python option to enable python
   extensions. 

2. Run 'make idl_full swig' to build extensions.

3. At some stage there will be a proper system for installing the
   extensions, but right now it's easier to run them in place.  Set
   your PYTHONPATH to include the modules.  From the Samba source
   directory, run:

   export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/scripting/swig

Now you can go nuts and use the extensions.  Check the
scripting/swig/torture directory for a testsuite.  There will
hopefully be a bunch of usage examples somewhere.
