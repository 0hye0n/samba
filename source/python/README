1. Requirements

In order to be able to compile samba-python you need to have
python and the python-dev packages installed.

2. Checking out the CVS HEAD branch of Samba and Samba-Python

In your shell, type:

$ cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot login

When asked for a password, type 'cvs'.

Now, type:

$ cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot co samba

This might probably take a while. When everything is downloaded,
check out the samba-python tree:

$ cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot co samba-python

Now that you have both cvs modules, move the directory 'samba-python' to 
inside the samba source tree, using: 

$ mv samba-python samba/source/python

Now, go to the samba/source directory and apply the samba-head.patch patch:

$ cd samba/source && patch -p0 < location/to/samba-python/samba-head.patch

You can now configure samba as usual and create the python extension:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure 
$ make python_ext

Now, you can install the modules:

$ cp build/lib.*/*.so /usr/lib/python2.1/lib-dynload/

(the directory /usr/lib/python2.1 may vary, depending on your installation)

Samba-python should work now!
