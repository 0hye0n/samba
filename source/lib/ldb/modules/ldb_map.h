 * that need to map attributes.
 *
 * The term 'remote' in this header refers to the connection where the 
 * original schema is used on while 'local' means the local connection 
 * that any upper layers will use.
 *
 * All local attributes will have to have a definition. Not all remote 
 * attributes need a definition as LDB is a lot less stricter then LDAP 
 * (in other words, sending unknown attributes to an LDAP server hurts us, 
 * returning too much attributes in ldb_search() doesn't)
