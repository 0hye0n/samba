This directory contains a skeleton backend for ldb backends that allow 
using an LDAP server while mapping the attributes in that schema to 
another schema. This backend will never be used itself but instead have 
other backends based on it (e.g. ldb_samba3 for a Samba3-LDAP-to-samdb 
backend)

Each backend that uses this skeleton has to specify an array of 
struct objectclass_mapping's (see ldb_map.h).

If no mappings are defined for an objectclass, it will be kept as is.

Special mapping routine for dn's (calls rdn mapping routine)
