Here is a very brief howto for setting up a simple test of the current
ctdb code.

1) put smb.conf.cluster, smb.conf.node1, smb.conf.node2 and nlist.txt in the
   prefix/etc/ directory for samba4. Adjust them for your local paths.

2) use the script cluster_start.sh to start the two nodes. You can
   pass extra arguments to start under valgrind or gdb. For example:

     cluster_start.sh "gdb --args"

3) test using the following command:

  bin/locktest //localhost/test //win2003/test -Uadministrator%password -l unclist.txt

  with the unclist.txt supplied

NOTE: This is very much experimental code!
