This directory contains test scripts that are useful for running a
bunch of tests all at once. 

===============
Available tests
===============
The available tests are obtained from a script, usually 
selftest/samba{3,4}_tests.sh. This script should for each test output 
the name of the test, the command to run and the environment that should be 
provided.

============
Environments
============
Tests often need to run against a server with particular things set up, 
a "environment". This environment is provided by the test "target": Samba 3, 
Samba 4 or Windows.

The following environments are currently available:

 - none: No server set up, no variables set.
 - dc: Domain controller set up. The following environment variables will 
   be set:
     * USERNAME: Administrator user name
	 * PASSWORD: Administrator password
	 * DOMAIN: Domain name
	 * REALM: Realm name
	 * SERVER: DC host name 
	 * SERVER_IP: DC IPv4 address
	 * NETBIOSNAME: DC NetBIOS name
	 * NETIOSALIAS: DC NetBIOS alias

 - member: Domain controller and member server that is joined to it set up. The
   following environment variables will be set:
     * USERNAME: Domain administrator user name
	 * PASSWORD: Domain administrator password
	 * DOMAIN: Domain name
	 * REALM: Realm name
	 * SERVER: Name of the member server


=============
Running tests
=============

To run all the tests use:

   make test

To run a quick subset (aiming for about 1 minute of testing) run:

   make quicktest

To run a specific test, use this syntax

   make test TESTS=testname

for example

   make test TESTS=samba4.BASE-DELETE
