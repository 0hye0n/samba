- split up proto.h into headers with public or private prototypes. 
  Public prototypes can be marked with _PUBLIC_ in the source
   - get rid of include/structs.h
- install Samba-specific headers in $INCLUDEDIR/samba-4.0. talloc.h, tdb.h and 
	ldb.h belong in $INCLUDEDIR
- never install -rpath binaries / libraries, always relink before install
 - keep files without -rpath in bin/install
- init functions may be called more then once as different libraries 
 (in Samba or other projects) can use the same (3rd) library.
- add register function to smbtorture
- init functions per shared library / binary
- install shared modules
- call load_modules() from subsystems/libraries/binaries with modules
- remove smb_build.h include from includes.h and INIT_OBJ_FILES. Replace 
  with individual include/smb_build.h includes
- improve (un)install scripts (rewrite in perl?)
