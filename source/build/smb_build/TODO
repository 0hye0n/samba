- Add --export-dynamic for each subsystem that has modules
- let the build system implement some make functions($(patsubst),$(wildcard),...) and use our own implementations where `make' does not support them
- include extra_flags.txt using Makefile construction if 
  supported by current make
- make --enable-dso the default
 - fix module loading for selftest during non-developer builds
- clearer distinction between dcerpc and ndr. seperate interface tables?
- saner names for:
	libcli.so.0.0.1 (rename to libsmb?)
	libcli_cldap.so.0.0.1 (rename to libcldap?)
	libcli_nbt.so.0.0.1 (rename to libnbt?)
	libcli_wrepl.so.0.0.1 (rename to libwrepl?)
- generate headermap.txt

set of test scripts that check the code:
- configure_check_unused.pl
- find_unused_macros.pl
- find_unused_makefilevars.pl
- find_unused_options.sh
- findstatic.pl
- minimal_includes.pl
- check dependencies based on #include lines ?
- check whether private headers are not used outside their own subsystem
- undocumented (no manpage) installed binaries
