- saner names for some of the .pc files
- .pc files also when there is a public header?
- get rid of include/structs.h and include/proto.h
 - support including a custom header by librpc/gen_ndr/*.c files
 - if a ndr_.*_man.h file exists, include it.
- plugin loading support in ldb
- proper #include dependencies:
  for each subsystem:
  - include line in Makefile
  - rule in Makefile
- install autogenerated headers (seperate directory)
- subdir handler for install headers into a specific directory

set of test scripts that check the code:
- configure_check_unused.pl
- find_unused_macros.pl
- find_unused_makefilevars.pl
- find_unused_options.sh
- findstatic.pl
- minimal_includes.pl
- check dependencies based on #include lines ?
- check whether private headers are not used outside their own subsystem
