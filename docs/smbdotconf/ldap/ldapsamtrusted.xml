<para>
By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the
Unix-style NSS subsystem to access user and group information. Due to the way
Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group this inevitably
leads to inefficiencies. One important question a user needs to know is the
list of groups he is member of. The plain Unix model involves a complete
enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP. In this
particular case there often optimized functions are available in Unix, but for
other queries there is no optimized function available.</para>

<para>To make Samba scale well in large environments, the ldapsam:trusted=yes
option assumes that the complete user and group database that is relevant to
Samba is stored in LDAP with the standard posixAccount/posixGroup model, and
that the Samba auxiliary object classes are stored together with the the posix
data in the same LDAP object. If these assumptions are met,
ldapsam:trusted=yes can be activated and Samba can completely bypass the NSS
system to query user information. Optimized LDAP queries can speed up domain
logon and administration tasks a lot. Depending on the size of the LDAP
database a factor of 100 or more for common queries is easily achieved.</para>
