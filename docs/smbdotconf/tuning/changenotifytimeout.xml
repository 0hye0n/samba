    <para>This SMB allows a client to tell a server to 
    &quot;watch&quot; a particular directory for any changes and only reply to
    the SMB request when a change has occurred. Such constant scanning of
    a directory is expensive under UNIX, hence an <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> daemon only performs such a scan 
    on each requested directory once every <parameter moreinfo="none">change notify 
    timeout</parameter> seconds. Note that in 3.0.23 this has been changed to a
    per-share parameter and setting this to zero prevents any change notify directory
    scans completely on a share. This is to allow this paramter to be set to zero on
    shares configured for very large directories, where a Windows client will re-scan
    the entire directory after every delete operation (when deleting many files) due to
    the change notify triggering. This is an extremely expensive operation on some
    systems.</para>
