<description>
    <para>Specifies whether Samba should try 
    to use Unicode on the wire by default. Note: This does NOT
    mean that samba will assume that the UNIX machine uses Unicode!
</para>

<warning><para>DO NOT change this parameter</para><para>If Unicode is
disabled, certain clients (Win2k, WinXP) are known to crash during
domain logons, and many other aspects of the protocol have major known
issues.  Microsoft does not produce a server that does not support
Unicode, so probably never tests this combination.</para></warning>
