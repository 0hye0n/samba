	The purpose of the idmap backend parameter is to allow idmap to NOT use the local idmap
	tdb file to obtain SID to UID / GID mappings, but instead to obtain them from a common
	LDAP backend. This way all domain members and controllers will have the same UID and GID
	to SID mappings. This avoids the risk of UID / GID inconsistencies across UNIX / Linux
	systems that are sharing information over protocols other than SMB/CIFS (ie: NFS).
	</para>

	<para>
	An alternate method of SID to UID / GID  mapping can be achieved using the idmap_rid
	plug-in. This plug-in uses the account RID to derive the UID and GID by adding the
	RID to a base value specified. This utility requires that the parameter
	<quote>allow trusted domains = No</quote> must be specified, as it is not compatible
	with multiple domain environments. The idmap uid and idmap gid ranges must also be
	specified.
