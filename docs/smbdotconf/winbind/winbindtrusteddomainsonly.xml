	<para>
	This parameter is designed to allow Samba servers that are members of a Samba controlled domain to use
	UNIX accounts distributed via NIS, rsync, or LDAP as the uid's for winbindd users in the hosts primary domain.
	Therefore, the user <literal>DOMAIN\user1</literal> would be mapped to the account user1 in /etc/passwd
	instead of allocating a new uid for him or her.
