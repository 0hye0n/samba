<para>
Originally introduced with the intent to mimick the Microsoft Windows command that has the same name, the
<command>net</command> command has morphed into a very powerful instrument that has become an essential part
of the Samba network administrator's toolbox. The Samba Team have introduced tools, such as
<command>smbgroupedit, rpcclient</command> from which really useful have been integrated into the
<command>net</command>. The <command>smbgroupedit</command> command was absorbed entirely into the
<command>net</command>, while only some features of the <command>rpcclient</command> command have been
ported to it. Anyone who finds older references to these utilities and to the functionality they provided
should look at the <command>net</command> command before searching elsewhere.
