Samba now supports domain logons, network logon scripts and user profiles.
The support is still experimental, but it seems to work.

The support is also not complete. Samba does not yet support the
sharing of the SAM database with other systems yet, or remote
administration. Support for these kind of things should be added
sometime in the future.

The domain support only works for WfWg and Win95 clients. Support for
NT and OS/2 clients is still being worked on and currently does not
work. 

Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server, make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.


To use domain logons and profiles you need to do the following:

1) Setup nmbd and smbd and configure the smb.conf so that Samba is
acting as the master browser. See INSTALL.txt and BROWSING.txt for
details. 

2) create a share called [netlogon] in your smb.conf. This share should
be readable by all users, and probably should not be writeable. This
share will hold your network logon scripts, and the CONFIG.POL file
(Note: for details on the CONFIG.POL file, refer to the Microsoft
Windows NT Administration documentation.  The format of these files
is not known, so you will need to use Microsoft tools.)

For example I have used:

   [netlogon]
    path = /data/dos/netlogon
    writeable = no
    guest ok = yes

Note that it is important that this share is not writeable by ordinary
users, in a secure environment: ordinary users should not be allowed
to modify or add files that another user's computer would then download
when they log in.

3) in the [global] section of smb.conf set the following:

   domain logons = yes
   logon script = %U.bat

the choice of batch file is, of course, up to you. The above would
give each user a separate batch file as the %U will be changed to
their username automatically. The other standard % macros may also be
used. You can make the batch files come from a subdirectory by using
soemthing like:

   logon script = scripts\%U.bat

4) create the batch files to be run when the user logs in. If the batch
file doesn't exist then no batch file will be run. 

In the batch files you need to be careful to use DOS style cr/lf line
endings. If you don't then DOS may get confused. I suggest you use a
DOS editor to remotely edit the files if you don't know how to produce
DOS style files under unix.

5) Use smbclient with the -U option for some users to make sure that
the \\server\NETLOGON share is available, the batch files are visible
and they are readable by the users.

6) you will probabaly find that your clients automatically mount the
\\SERVER\NETLOGON share as drive z: while logging in. You can put some
useful programs there to execute from the batch files.

NOTE: You must be using "security = user" or "security = server" for
domain logons to work correctly. Share level security won't work
correctly.


User Profiles

1) in the [global] section of smb.conf set the following:

  logon path = \\profileserver\profileshare\profilepath\%U

The default for this option is \\%L\%U, namely \\sambaserver\username,
The \\L%\%U services is created automatically by the [homes] service.

If you are using a samba server for the profiles, you _must_ make the
share specified in the logon path browseable.  Windows 95 appears to
check that it can see the share and any subdirectories within that share
specified by the logon path option, rather than just connecting straight
away.  

When a user first logs in on Windows 95, the file user.dat is created,
as are folders "start menu", "desktop", "programs" and "nethood".  
These directories and their contents will be merged with the local
versions stored in c:\windows\profiles\username on subsequent logins,
taking the most recent from each.

The user.dat file contains all the user's preferences.  If you wish to
enforce a set of preferences, rename their user.dat file to user.man,
and deny them write access to the file.
