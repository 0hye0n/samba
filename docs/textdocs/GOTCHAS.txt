This file lists real Gotchas to watch out for:
=========================================================================
Item Number:	1.0
Description:	Problem Detecting Interfaces
Symptom:	Workstations do NOT see Samba server in Browse List
OS:		RedHat - Rembrandt Beta 2
Platform:	Intel
Date:		August 16, 1996
Submitted By:	John H Terpstra <jht@aquasoft.com.au>
Details:
	By default RedHat Rembrandt-II during installation adds an
	entry to /etc/hosts as follows:-
		127.0.0.1 loopback "hostname"."domainname"

	This causes Samba to loop back onto the loopback interface.
	The result is that Samba fails to communicate correctly with
	the world and therefor may fail to correctly negotiate who
	is the master browse list holder and who is the master browser.

Corrective Action:	Delete the entry after the word loopback
	in the line starting 127.0.0.1
=========================================================================
Item Number:	2.0
Description:	Problems with MS Windows NT Server network logon service
Symptom:	Loss of Domain Logon Services and failed Windows NT / 95
		logon attempts.
OS:		All Unix systems with Windows NT Domain Control environments.
Platform:	All
Date:		February 1, 1997
Submitted By:	John H Terpstra <jht@aquasoft.com.au>
Details:
	Samba is configured for Domain logon control in a network
	where a Windows NT Domain Primary Controller is running.

	Case 1:
		The Windows NT Server is shut down, then restarted. Then
		the Samba server is reconfigured so that it NO LONGER offers
		Domain logon services. Windows NT and 95 workstations can no
		longer log onto the domain. Ouch!!!

	Case 2:
		The Windows NT Server which is running the Network logon
		Service is shut down and restarted while Samba is a domain
		controller offering the Domain LogOn service. Windows NT
		Workstation and Server can no longer log onto the network.

	Cause:
		Windows NT checks at start up to see if any domain logon
		controllers are already running within the domain. It finds
		Samba claiming to offer the service and therefore does NOT
		start it's Network Logon Service.

		Windows NT needs the Windows NT network logon service to gain
		from it's Domain controller's SAM database the security
		identifier for the user loging on.

Work-around:	Stop the Samba nmbd and smbd processes, then on the Windows
		NT Primary Domain Controller start the Network Logon Service.
		Now restart the Samba nmbd and smbd services.
