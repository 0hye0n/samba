You must first convert the profile from a local profile to a domain
profile on the MS Windows workstation as follows:

1. Log on as the LOCAL workstation administrator.

2. Right click on the 'My Computer' Icon, select 'Properties'

3. Click on the 'User Profiles' tab

4. Select the profile you wish to convert (click on it once)

5. Click on the button 'Copy To'

6. In the "Permitted to use" box, click on the 'Change' button.

7. Click on the 'Look in" area that lists the machine name, when you click
here it will open up a selection box. Click on the domain to which the
profile must be accessible.

Note: You will need to log on if a logon box opens up. Eg: In the connect
as: MIDEARTH\root, password: mypassword.

8. To make the profile capable of being used by anyone select 'Everyone'

9. Click OK. The Selection box will close.

10. Now click on the 'Ok' button to create the profile in the path you
nominated.

Done. You now have a profile that can be editted using the samba-3.0.0
profiles tool.

No difference. Samba handles the profile ACLs the same way Win2K does.
But understand that it is the Win2K client that does all the processing
of the SIDs on the ACLs in the profile NTUser.DAT file.
