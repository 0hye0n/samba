Some people report problems with "cacheing" of data. Generally the bug report 
goes like this:

- create a file on a unix box
- view the file on a PC via Samba
- change the file on the unix box
- look at the file again on the PC via Samba and the changes are not visible

The first thing to realise is that this is the expected behaviour! The SMB protocol
uses a thing called "opportunistic locking". This allows the client to "safely"
do client side cacheing of file data. The problem is that this cacheing is only
safe if all programs access the files via SMB. As soon as you access the data
via a non-SMB client then you will get data inconsistencies.

The solution is simple! Disable oplocks in smb.conf for those shares that need
to be accessed simutaneously from unix and windows. See the "oplocks" and
"veto oplock files" options in smb.conf(5)

Samba-1.9.18 series supports oplocks.
Samba-1.9.17 series does NOT.

In addition, you may care to explore the effect of making the following registry
entries under MS Windows NT4:

===================================================================================

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Paramete
rs]
"BufFilesDenyWrite"=dword:00000000
"BufNamedPipes"=dword:00000000
"UseOpportunisticLocking"=dword:00000000
"DormantFileLimit"=dword:00000000

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Paramete
rs\Linkage]
"UtilizeNtCaching"=dword:00000000

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Filesystem]
"Win95TruncateExtensions"=dword:00000000

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters]
"EnableOpLockForceClose"=dword:00000001
"EnableOpLocks"=dword:00000000


==================================================================================

The following registry entry may help under Windows 9X also:


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\VREDIR]
"DiscardCacheOnOpen"=string:00000001
