Outdated docs:
Manifest
docs/announce - out of date (announces 2.2.0) - should it go away?
docs/history - needs updating (is current up to 1998 - merge with 10year.html ?)
docs/docbook/manpages/net.8.sgml - Still not finished
docs/docbook/manpages/samba.7.sgml - Listing of samba programs is not complete
docs/docbook/manpages/smb.conf.5.sgml - 'restrict anonymous' isn't documented properly
docs/docbook/projdoc/Integrating-with-Windows.sgml - Should slowly go a way. Contains a little bit information about wins, a little bit about domain membership, a little about winbind, etc
docs/docbook/projdoc/PAM-Authentication-And-Samba.sgml
docs/docbook/projdoc/Printing.sgml - Cups is not documented, smbprint, printing /to/ a windows server... - Kurt Pfeifle
docs/docbook/projdoc/Samba-BDC-HOWTO.sgml - Needs update to 3.0
docs/docbook/projdoc/Samba-LDAP-HOWTO.sgml - Needs update to 3.0 ( http://www.unav.es/cti/ldap-smb/smb-ldap-3-howto.html )
docs/docbook/projdoc/Speed.sgml - contains outdated and invalid information
docs/docbook/projdoc/UNIX_INSTALL.sgml - Merge locking part with oplocks.sgml
docs/docbook/projdoc/printer_driver2.sgml - Needs integration with printing.sgml, still up to date?
docs/docbook/projdoc/upgrading-to-3.0.sgml - not finished yet
docs/docbook/projdoc/winbind.sgml - needs documentation for ADS
docs/textdocs/CUPS-PrintingInfo.txt - needs to be converted to sgml - Kurt Pfeifle
docs/textdocs/PROFILES.txt - needs to be converted to sgml
docs/textdocs/README.jis - Seems to need updating - possibly obsoleted by a newer japanese howto?
docs/docbook/manpages/ntlm_auth.1.sgml - Is very basic at the moment, parameters need better descriptions - abartlet

Stuff that needs to be documented:
wrepld
Windows NT 4.0 Style Trust Relationship
Winbind in a samba controlled domain
One Time Migration script from a Windows NT 4.0 PDC to a Samba PDC
ldap passwd sync

Not release-critical:
docs/docbook/devdoc/* - most of these docs are outdated and need updates...
docs/docbook/projdoc/Diagnosis.sgml - Needs extension
docs/docbook/manpages/rpcclient.1.sgml - Some commands could be documented more extensively
