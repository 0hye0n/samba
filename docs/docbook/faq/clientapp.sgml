<title>MS Office Setup reports "Cannot change properties of '\MSOFFICE\SETUP.INI'"</title>
<para>
When installing MS Office on a Samba drive for which you have admin
user permissions, ie. admin users = username, you will find the
setup program unable to complete the installation.
</para>

<para>
To get around this problem, do the installation without admin user
permissions The problem is that MS Office Setup checks that a file is
rdonly by trying to open it for writing.
</para>

<para>
Admin users can always open a file for writing, as they run as root.
You just have to install as a non-admin user and then use "chown -R"
to fix the owner.
