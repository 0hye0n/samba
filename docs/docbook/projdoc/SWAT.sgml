<title>SWAT - The Samba Web Admininistration Tool</title>

<para>
There are many and varied opinions regarding the usefulness or otherwise of SWAT.
No matter how hard one tries to produce the perfect configuration tool it remains
an object of personal taste. SWAT is a tool that will allow web based configuration
of samba. It has a wizard that may help to get samba configured quickly, it has context
sensitive help on each smb.conf parameter, it provides for monitoring of current state
of connection information, and it allows network wide MS Windows network password
management.

<title>SWAT Features and Benefits</title>

<para>
There are network administrators who believe that it is a good idea to write systems
documentation inside configuration files, for them SWAT will aways be a nasty tool. SWAT
does not store the configuration file in any intermediate form, rather, it stores only the
parameter settings, so when SWAT writes the smb.conf file to disk it will write only
those parameters that are at other than the default settings. The result is that all comments
will be lost from the smb.conf file. Additionally, the parameters will be written back in
internal ordering.
</para>

<para><note>
So before using SWAT please be warned - SWAT will completely replace your smb.conf with
a fully optimised file that has been stripped of all comments you might have placed there
and only non-default settings will be written to the file.

<para>
SWAT should be installed to run via the network super daemon. Depending on which system
your Unix/Linux system has you will have either an <filename>inetd</filename> or
<filename>xinetd</filename> based system.
