<title>SWAT - The Samba Web Admininistration Tool</title>

<para>
There are many and varied opinions regarding the usefulness or otherwise of SWAT.
No matter how hard one tries to produce the perfect configuration tool it remains
an object of personal taste. SWAT is a tool that will allow web based configuration
of samba. It has a wizard that may help to get samba configured quickly, it has context
sensitive help on each smb.conf parameter, it provides for monitoring of current state
of connection information, and it allows network wide MS Windows network password
management.

<title>SWAT Features and Benefits</title>

<para>
There are network administrators who believe that it is a good idea to write systems
documentation inside configuration files, for them SWAT will aways be a nasty tool. SWAT
does not store the configuration file in any intermediate form, rather, it stores only the
parameter settings, so when SWAT writes the smb.conf file to disk it will write only
those parameters that are at other than the default settings. The result is that all comments
will be lost from the smb.conf file. Additionally, the parameters will be written back in
internal ordering.
</para>

<note><para>
So before using SWAT please be warned - SWAT will completely replace your smb.conf with
a fully optimised file that has been stripped of all comments you might have placed there
and only non-default settings will be written to the file.
</para></note>

<para>
SWAT should be installed to run via the network super daemon. Depending on which system
your Unix/Linux system has you will have either an <filename>inetd</filename> or
<filename>xinetd</filename> based system.
</para>

<para>
The nature and location of the network super-daemon varies with the operating system
implementation. The control file (or files) can be located in the file 
<filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> or in the directory <filename>/etc/[x]inet.d</filename>
or similar.
</para>

<para>
The control entry for the older style file might be:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
	# swat is the Samba Web Administration Tool
	swat stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/sbin/swat swat
</programlisting></para>

<para>
A control file for the newer style xinetd could be:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
	# default: off
	# description: SWAT is the Samba Web Admin Tool. Use swat \
	#              to configure your Samba server. To use SWAT, \
	#              connect to port 901 with your favorite web browser.
	service swat
	{
		port    = 901
		socket_type     = stream
		wait    = no
		only_from = localhost
		user    = root
		server  = /usr/sbin/swat
		log_on_failure  += USERID
		disable = yes
	}
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Both the above examples assume that the <filename>swat</filename> binary has been
located in the <filename>/usr/sbin</filename> directory. In addition to the above
SWAT will use a directory access point from which it will load all it's help files,
as well as other control information. The default location for this on most Linux
systems is in the directory <filename>/usr/share/samba/swat</filename>.
</para>

<para>
Access to SWAT will prompt for a logon. If you log onto SWAT as any non-root user
the only permission allowed is to view certain aspects of configuration as well as
access to the password change facility.
</para>

<para>
So long as you log onto SWAT as the user <command>root</command> you should obtain
full change and commit ability.

<title>The SWAT Home Page</title>

<para>
The SWAT title page provides access to the latest Samba documentation. The manual page for
each samba component is accessible from this page as are the Samba-HOWTO-Collection (this 
document) as well as the O'Reilly book "Using Samba".
