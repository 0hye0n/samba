<title>Samba as a NT4 or Win2k domain member</title>

<sect1>

	<title>Joining an NT Domain with Samba 3.0</title>
	<para><emphasis>Assumptions:</emphasis>
	<programlisting>
		NetBIOS name: SERV1
		Win2K/NT domain name: DOM
		Domain's PDC NetBIOS name: DOMPDC
		Domain's BDC NetBIOS names: DOMBDC1 and DOMBDC2
	</programlisting>
	</para>

	<para>First, you must edit your &smb.conf; file to tell Samba it should
	now use domain security.</para>
	
	<para>Change (or add) your <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#SECURITY">
	<parameter>security =</parameter></ulink> line in the [global] section 
	of your &smb.conf; to read:</para>

	<para><command>security = domain</command></para>

	<para>Next change the <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#WORKGROUP"><parameter>
	workgroup =</parameter></ulink> line in the [global] section to read: </para>

	<para><command>workgroup = DOM</command></para>

	<para>as this is the name of the domain we are joining. </para>

	<para>You must also have the parameter <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#ENCRYPTPASSWORDS">
	<parameter>encrypt passwords</parameter></ulink> set to <constant>yes
	</constant> in order for your users to authenticate to the NT PDC.</para>

	<para>Finally, add (or modify) a <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#PASSWORDSERVER">
	<parameter>password server =</parameter></ulink> line in the [global]
	section to read: </para>

	<para><command>password server = DOMPDC DOMBDC1 DOMBDC2</command></para>

	<para>These are the primary and backup domain controllers Samba 
	will attempt to contact in order to authenticate users. Samba will 
	try to contact each of these servers in order, so you may want to 
	rearrange this list in order to spread out the authentication load 
	among domain controllers.</para>

	<para>Alternatively, if you want smbd to automatically determine 
	the list of Domain controllers to use for authentication, you may 
	set this line to be :</para>

	<para><command>password server = *</command></para>

	<para>This method, allows Samba to use exactly the same
        mechanism that NT does. This 
	method either broadcasts or uses a WINS database in order to
	find domain controllers to authenticate against.</para>

	<para>In order to actually join the domain, you must run this
        command:</para>

	<para><prompt>root# </prompt><userinput>net join -S DOMPDC
	-U<replaceable>Administrator%password</replaceable></userinput></para>

	<para>
	If the <userinput>-S DOMPDC</userinput> argument is not given then
	the domain name will be obtained from smb.conf.
	</para>

	<para>as we are joining the domain DOM and the PDC for that domain 
	(the only machine that has write access to the domain SAM database) 
	is DOMPDC. The <replaceable>Administrator%password</replaceable> is 
	the login name and password for an account which has the necessary 
	privilege to add machines to the domain.  If this is successful 
	you will see the message:</para>

	<para><computeroutput>Joined domain DOM.</computeroutput>
	or <computeroutput>Joined 'SERV1' to realm 'MYREALM'</computeroutput>
	</para>

	<para>in your terminal window. See the <ulink url="net.8.html">
	net(8)</ulink> man page for more details.</para>
	
	<para>This process joins the server to the domain
	without having to create the machine trust account on the PDC
	beforehand.</para>

	<para>This command goes through the machine account password 
	change protocol, then writes the new (random) machine account 
	password for this Samba server into a file in the same directory 
	in which an smbpasswd file would be stored - normally :</para>

	<para><filename>/usr/local/samba/private/secrets.tdb</filename></para>

	<para>This file is created and owned by root and is not 
	readable by any other user. It is the key to the domain-level 
	security for your system, and should be treated as carefully 
	as a shadow password file.</para>

	<para>Finally, restart your Samba daemons and get ready for 
	clients to begin using domain security!</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
	<title>Why is this better than security = server?</title>

	<para>Currently, domain security in Samba doesn't free you from 
	having to create local Unix users to represent the users attaching 
	to your server. This means that if domain user <constant>DOM\fred
	</constant> attaches to your domain security Samba server, there needs 
	to be a local Unix user fred to represent that user in the Unix 
	filesystem. This is very similar to the older Samba security mode 
	<ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#SECURITYEQUALSSERVER">security = server</ulink>, 
	where Samba would pass through the authentication request to a Windows 
	NT server in the same way as a Windows 95 or Windows 98 server would.
	</para>
	
	<para>Please refer to the <ulink url="winbind.html">Winbind 
	paper</ulink> for information on a system to automatically
	assign UNIX uids and gids to Windows NT Domain users and groups.
	</para>

	<para>The advantage to domain-level security is that the 
	authentication in domain-level security is passed down the authenticated 
	RPC channel in exactly the same way that an NT server would do it. This 
	means Samba servers now participate in domain trust relationships in 
	exactly the same way NT servers do (i.e., you can add Samba servers into 
	a resource domain and have the authentication passed on from a resource
	domain PDC to an account domain PDC).</para>

	<para>In addition, with <command>security = server</command> every Samba 
	daemon on a server has to keep a connection open to the 
	authenticating server for as long as that daemon lasts. This can drain 
	the connection resources on a Microsoft NT server and cause it to run 
	out of available connections. With <command>security = domain</command>, 
	however, the Samba daemons connect to the PDC/BDC only for as long 
	as is necessary to authenticate the user, and then drop the connection, 
	thus conserving PDC connection resources.</para>

	<para>And finally, acting in the same manner as an NT server 
	authenticating to a PDC means that as part of the authentication 
	reply, the Samba server gets the user identification information such 
	as the user SID, the list of NT groups the user belongs to, etc. </para>
