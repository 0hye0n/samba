documentation represents a major revision or layout as well as contents.

The Samba-Team would like to express sincere thanks to the many people who have with
or without their knowledge contributed to this update. The size and scope of this
project would not have been possible without significant community contribution. A not
insignificant number of ideas for inclusion (if not content itself) has been obtained
from a number of Unofficial HOWTOs - to each such author a big "Thank-you" is also offered.
Please keep publishing you Unofficial HOWTO's - they are a source of inspiration and
application knowledge that is most to be desired by may Samba users and administrators.
