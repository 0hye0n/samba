<title>How to Install and Test SAMBA</title>

<sect1>
	<title>Obtaining and installing samba</title>

	<para>Binary packages of samba are included in almost any Linux or 
	Unix distribution. There are also some packages available at 
	<ulink url="http://samba.org/">the samba homepage</ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>If you need to compile samba from source, check the 
	<link linkend="compiling">appropriate appendix chapter</link>.</para>

	<para>If you have already installed samba, or if your operating system
	was pre-installed with samba, then you may not need to bother with this
	chapter. On the other hand, you may want to read this chapter anyhow
	for information about updating samba.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1>
	<title>Configuring samba</title>

	<para>Samba's configuration is stored in the smb.conf file, 
	that usually resides in <filename>/etc/samba/smb.conf</filename> 
	or <filename>/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf</filename>. You can either 
	edit this file yourself or do it using one of the many graphical 
	tools that are available, such as the web-based interface swat, that 
	is included with samba.</para>
	
<sect2>
	<title>Editing the <filename>smb.conf</filename> file</title>
	
	<para>There are sample configuration files in the examples 
	subdirectory in the distribution. I suggest you read them 
	carefully so you can see how the options go together in 
	practice. See the man page for all the options.</para>

	<para>The simplest useful configuration file would be 
	something like this:</para>

	<para><programlisting>
[global]
	workgroup = MYGROUP

[homes]
	guest ok = no
	read only = no
	</programlisting></para>
	
	<para>which would allow connections by anyone with an 
	account on the server, using either their login name or 
	"<command>homes</command>" as the service name. (Note that I also set the 
	workgroup that Samba is part of. See BROWSING.txt for details)</para>
	
	<para>Make sure you put the <filename>smb.conf</filename> file in the same place 
	you specified in the<filename>Makefile</filename> (the default is to 
	look for it in <filename>/usr/local/samba/lib/</filename>).</para>

	<para>For more information about security settings for the 
	<command>[homes]</command> share please refer to the chapter 
	<link linkend="securing-samba">Securing Samba</link>.</para>

<sect3>
	<title>Test your config file with 
	<command>testparm</command></title>

	<para>It's important that you test the validity of your
	<filename>smb.conf</filename> file using the <application>testparm</application> program. 
	If testparm runs OK then it will list the loaded services. If 
	not it will give an error message.</para>

	<para>Make sure it runs OK and that the services look 
	reasonable before proceeding. </para>

	<para>Always run testparm again when you change 
	<filename>smb.conf</filename>!</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>

	<sect2>
	<title>SWAT</title>

	<para>
	SWAT is a web-based interface that helps you configure samba. 
	SWAT might not be available in the samba package on your platform, 
	but in a separate package. Please read the swat manpage 
	on compiling, installing and configuring swat from source.
	</para>

	<para>To launch SWAT just run your favorite web browser and 
	point it at "http://localhost:901/". Replace <replaceable>localhost</replaceable> with the name of the computer you are running samba on if you 
	are running samba on a different computer than your browser.</para>

	<para>Note that you can attach to SWAT from any IP connected 
	machine but connecting from a remote machine leaves your 
	connection open to password sniffing as passwords will be sent 
	in the clear over the wire. </para>
	</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>
	<title>Try listing the shares available on your 
	server</title>

	<para><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>smbclient -L 
	<replaceable>yourhostname</replaceable></userinput></para>

	<para>You should get back a list of shares available on 
	your server. If you don't then something is incorrectly setup. 
	Note that this method can also be used to see what shares 
	are available on other LanManager clients (such as WfWg).</para>

	<para>If you choose user level security then you may find 
	that Samba requests a password before it will list the shares. 
	See the <command>smbclient</command> man page for details. (you 
	can force it to list the shares without a password by
	adding the option -U% to the command line. This will not work 
	with non-Samba servers)</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
	<title>Try connecting with the unix client</title>
	
	<para><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>smbclient <replaceable>
	//yourhostname/aservice</replaceable></userinput></para>
	
	<para>Typically the <replaceable>yourhostname</replaceable> 
	would be the name of the host where you installed &smbd;. 
	The <replaceable>aservice</replaceable> is 
	any service you have defined in the &smb.conf;
	file. Try your user name if you just have a <command>[homes]</command>
	section
	in &smb.conf;.</para>

	<para>For example if your unix host is <replaceable>bambi</replaceable>
	and your login name is <replaceable>fred</replaceable> you would type:</para>

	<para><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>smbclient //<replaceable>bambi</replaceable>/<replaceable>fred</replaceable>
	</userinput></para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
	<title>Try connecting from a DOS, WfWg, Win9x, WinNT, 
	Win2k, OS/2, etc... client</title>
	
	<para>Try mounting disks. eg:</para>

	<para><prompt>C:\WINDOWS\> </prompt><userinput>net use d: \\servername\service
	</userinput></para>

	<para>Try printing. eg:</para>

	<para><prompt>C:\WINDOWS\> </prompt><userinput>net use lpt1:
	\\servername\spoolservice</userinput></para>

	<para><prompt>C:\WINDOWS\> </prompt><userinput>print filename
	</userinput></para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
	<title>What If Things Don't Work?</title>
	
	<para>Then you might read the file chapter 
	<link linkend="diagnosis">Diagnosis</link> and the 
	FAQ. If you are still stuck then try to follow 
	the <link linkend="problems">Analysing and Solving Problems chapter</link>
	Samba has been successfully installed at thousands of sites worldwide,
	so maybe someone else has hit your problem and has overcome it. </para>
