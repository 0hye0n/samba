<title>Stand-Alone Servers</title>

<para>
Stand-Alone servers are independant of an Domain Controllers on the network.
They are NOT domain members and function more like workgroup servers. In many
cases a stand-alone server is configured with a minimum of security control
with the intent that all data served will be readilly accessible to all users.

<title>Features and Benefits</title>

<para>
Stand-Alone servers can be as secure or as insecure as needs dictate. They can
have simple or complex configurations. Above all, despite the hoopla about
Domain security they remain a very common installation.
</para>

<para>
If all that is needed is a server for read-only files, or for
printers alone, it may not make sense to affect a complex installation.
For example: A drafting office needs to store old drawings and reference
standards. No-one can write files to the server as it is legislatively
important that all documents remain unaltered. A share mode read-only stand-alone
server is an ideal solution.
</para>

<para>
Another situation that warrants simplicity is an office that has many printers
that are queued off a single central server. Everyone needs to be able to print
to the printers, there is no need to affect any access controls and no files will
be served from the print server. Again a share mode stand-alone server makes
a great solution.

<title>Background</title>

<para>
The term <emphasis>stand alone server</emphasis> means that the server
will provide local authentication and access control for all resources
that are available from it. In general this means that there will be a
local user database. In more technical terms, it means that resources
on the machine will either be made available in either SHARE mode or in
USER mode.
</para>

<para>
No special action is needed other than to create user accounts. Stand-alone
servers do NOT provide network logon services. This means that machines that
use this server do NOT perform a domain log onto it. Whatever logon facility
the workstations are subject to is independant of this machine. It is however
necessary to accomodate any network user so that the logon name they use will
be translated (mapped) locally on the stand-alone server to a locally known
user name. There are several ways this cane be done.
</para>

<para>
Samba tends to blur the distinction a little in respect of what is
a stand-alone server. This is because the authentication database may be
local or on a remote server, even if from the samba protocol perspective
the samba server is NOT a member of a domain security context.
</para>

<para>
Through the use of PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) and nsswitch
(the name service switcher) the source of authentication may reside on 
another server. We would be inclined to call this the authentication server.
This means that the samba server may use the local Unix/Linux system
password database (/etc/passwd or /etc/shadow), may use a local smbpasswd
file, or may use an LDAP back end, or even via PAM and Winbind another CIFS/SMB
server for authentication.

<title>Example Configuration</title>

<para>
The following examples are designed to inspire simplicity. It is too easy to
attempt a high level of creativity and to introduce too much complexity in
server and network design.
