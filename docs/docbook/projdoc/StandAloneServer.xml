<title>Stand Alone Server</title>

<para>
The term <emphasis>stand alone server</emphasis> means that the server
will provide local authentication and access control for all resources
that are available from it. In general this means that there will be a
local user database. In more technical terms, it means that resources
on the machine will either be made available in either SHARE mode or in
USER mode. SHARE mode and USER mode security are documented under
discussions regarding "security mode". The smb.conf configuration parameters
that control security mode are: "security = user" and "security = share".
</para>

<para>
No special action is needed other than to create user accounts. Stand-alone
servers do NOT provide network logon services, meaning that machines that
use this server do NOT perform a domain logon but instead make use only of
the MS Windows logon which is local to the MS Windows workstation/server.
</para>

<para>
Samba tends to blur the distinction a little in respect of what is
a stand alone server. This is because the authentication database may be
local or on a remote server, even if from the samba protocol perspective
the samba server is NOT a member of a domain security context.
</para>

<para>
Through the use of PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) and nsswitch
(the name service switcher) the source of authentication may reside on 
another server. We would be inclined to call this the authentication server.
This means that the samba server may use the local Unix/Linux system
password database (/etc/passwd or /etc/shadow), may use a local smbpasswd
file (/etc/samba/smbpasswd or /usr/local/samba/lib/private/smbpasswd), or
may use an LDAP back end, or even via PAM and Winbind another CIFS/SMB
server for authentication.
