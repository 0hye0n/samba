<title>CUPS Printing Support</title>

<sect1>
<title>Introduction</title>
	
<para>
The Common Unix Print System (CUPS) has become very popular, but to many it is
a very mystical tool. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding CUPS and how
it works. The result is seen in a large number of posting on the samba mailing lists
expressing frustration when MS Windows printers appear not to work with a CUPS
backr-end.
</para>

<para>
This is a good time to point out how CUPS can be used and what it does. CUPS is more
than just a print spooling system - it is a complete printer management system that
complies with HTTP and IPP protocols. It can be managed remotely via a web browser
and it can print using http and ipp protocols.
</para>

<para>
CUPS allows to creation of RAW printers (ie: NO file format translation) as well as
SMART printers (ie: CUPS does file format conversion as required for the printer). In
many ways this gives CUPS similar capabilities to the MS Windows print monitoring
system. Of course, if you are a CUPS advocate, you would agrue that CUPS is better!
In any case, let us now move on to explore how one may configure CUPS for interfacing
with MS Windows print clients via Samba.
</para>

<para>
<ulink url="http://www.cups.org/">CUPS</ulink> is a newcomer in the UNIX printing scene,
which has convinced many people upon first trial already. However, it has quite a few
new features, which make it different from other, more traditional printing systems.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Configuring &smb.conf; for CUPS</title>

<para>
Printing with CUPS in the most basic &smb.conf;
setup in Samba-3  only needs two settings: <command>printing = cups</command> and
<command>printcap = cups</command>. While CUPS itself doesn't need a printcap
anymore, the <filename>cupsd.conf</filename> configuration file knows two directives
(example: <command>Printcap /etc/printcap</command> and <command>PrintcapFormat
BSD</command>), which control if such a file should be created for the
convenience of third party applications. Make sure it is set! For details see
<command>man cupsd.conf</command> and other CUPS-related documentation.
</para>

<para>
If SAMBA is compiled against libcups, then <command>printcap = cups</command> uses the
CUPS API to list printers, submit jobs, etc. Otherwise it maps to the System V commands
with an additional <parameter>-oraw</parameter> option for printing. On a Linux system,
you can use the <command>ldd</command> command to find out details (ldd may not be
present on other OS platforms, or its function may be embodied by a different command):
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>transmeta:/home/kurt # ldd `which smbd`
        libssl.so.0.9.6 => /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.6 (0x4002d000)
        libcrypto.so.0.9.6 => /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6 (0x4005a000)
        libcups.so.2 => /usr/lib/libcups.so.2 (0x40123000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x401e8000)
        libnsl.so.1 => /lib/libnsl.so.1 (0x401ec000)

        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 =&gt; /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
</programlisting></para>

<para>
The line "libcups.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcups.so.2
(0x40123000)" shows there is CUPS support compiled into this version of
Samba. If this is the case, and <command>printing = cups</command> is set, then any
otherwise manually set print command in &smb.conf; is ignored.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>CUPS - RAW Print Through Mode</title>

<note>
<para>
When used in raw print through mode is will be necessary to use the printer
vendor's drivers in each Windows client PC.
</para>
</note>

<para>
When CUPS printers are configured for RAW print-through mode operation it is the
responsibility of the Samba client to fully render the print job (file) in a format
that is suitable for direct delivery to the printer. In this case CUPS will NOT
do any print file format conversion work.
</para>

<para>
The CUPS files that need to be correctly set for RAW mode printers to work are:

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><filename>/etc/cups/mime.types</filename></para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><filename>/etc/cups/mime.convs</filename></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

Both contain entries that must be uncommented to allow <emphasis>RAW</emphasis> mode
operation.
</para>

<para>
Firstly, to enable CUPS based printing from Samba the following options must be
enabled in your &smb.conf; file [globals] section:

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>printing = CUPS</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>printcap = CUPS</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

When these parameters are specified the print directives in &smb.conf; (as well as in
samba itself) will be ignored because samba will directly interface with CUPS through
it's application program interface (API) - so long as Samba has been compiled with
CUPS library (libcups) support. If samba has NOT been compiled with CUPS support then
printing will use the System V AT&amp;T command set with the <emphasis>-oraw</emphasis> 
option automatically passing through.
</para>

<para>
Cupsomatic (an enhanced printing utility that is part of some CUPS implementations) 
on the Samba/CUPS server does *not* add any features if a file is really
printed "raw".  However, if you have loaded the driver for the Windows client from
the CUPS server, using the "cupsaddsmb" utility, and if this driver is one using
a "Foomatic" PPD, the PJL header in question is already added on the Windows client,
at the time when the driver initially generated the PostScript data and CUPS in true
"-oraw" manner doesn't remove this PJL header and passes the file "as is" to its
printer communication backend.
</para>

<note><para>NOTE: editing in the "mime.convs" and the "mime.types" file does not *enforce*
"raw" printing, it only *allows* it.</para></note>

<para>
Print files that arrive from MS Windows printing are "auto-typed" by CUPS. This aids
the process of determining proper treatment while in the print queue system.

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	Files generated by PCL drivers and directed at PCK printers get auto-typed as
	<filename>application/octet-stream</filename>. Unknown file format types also
	get auto-typed with this tag.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	Files generated by a Postscript driver and directed at a Postscript printer
	are auto-typed depending on the auto-detected most suitable MIME type as:

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>* application/postscript</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>* application/vnd.cups-postscript</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>


<para>
"application/postscript" first goes thru the "pstops" filter (where the page counting
and accounting takes place). The outcome will be of MIME type
"application/vnd.cups-postscript". The pstopsfilter reads and uses information from
the PPD and inserts user-provided options into the PostScript file. As a consequence,
the filtered file could possibly have an unwanted PJL header.
</para>

<para>
"application/postscript" will be all files with a ".ps", ".ai", ".eps" suffix or which
have as their first character string one of "%!" or "&gt;04&lt;%".
</para>

<para>
"application/vnd.cups-postscript" will files which contain the string
"LANGUAGE=POSTSCRIPT" (or similar variations with different capitalization) in the
first 512 bytes, and also contain the "PJL super escape code" in the first 128 bytes
("&gt;1B&lt;%-12345X"). Very likely, most PostScript files generated on Windows using a CUPS
or other PPD, will have to be auto-typed as "vnd.cups-postscript".  A file produced
with a "Generic PostScript driver" will just be tagged "application/postscript".
</para>

<para>
Once the file is in "application/vnd.cups-postscript" format, either "pstoraster"
or "cupsomatic" will take over (depending on the printer configuration, as
determined by the PPD in use).
</para>

<note><para>
A printer queue with *no* PPD associated to it is a "raw" printer and all files
will go directly there as received by the spooler. The exeptions are file types
"application/octet-stream" which need "passthrough feature" enabled.
"Raw" queues don't do any filtering at all, they hand the file directly to the
CUPS backend. This backend is responsible for the sending of the data to the device
(as in the "device URI" notation as lpd://, socket://, smb://, ipp://, http://,
parallel:/, serial:/, usb:/ etc.)
</para></note>

<note><para>
"cupsomatic"/Foomatic are *not* native CUPS drivers and they don't ship with CUPS.
They are a Third Party add-on, developed at Linuxprinting.org.  As such, they are
a brilliant hack to make all models (driven by Ghostscript drivers/filters in
traditional spoolers) also work via CUPS, with the same (good or bad!) quality
as in these other spoolers. "cupsomatic" is only a vehicle to execute a ghostscript
commandline at that stage in the CUPS filtering chain, where "normally" the native
CUPS "pstoraster" filter would kick in.  cupsomatic by-passes pstoraster, "kidnaps"
the printfile from CUPS away and re-directs it to go through Ghostscipt. CUPS accepts this,
because the associated CUPS-O-Matic-/Foomatic-PPD specifies:
</para>

<programlisting>
   *cupsFilter:  "application/vnd.cups-postscript 0 cupsomatic"
</programlisting>

<para>
This line persuades CUPS to hand the file to cupsomatic, once it has successfully
converted it to the MIME type "application/vnd.cups-postscript". This conversion will not
happen for Jobs arriving from Windows which are auto-typed "application/octet-stream",
with the according changes in "/etc/cups/mime.types" in place.
</para></note>

<para>
CUPS is widely configurable and flexible, even regarding its filtering mechanism.
Another workaround in some situations would be to have
in "/etc/cups/mime.types" entries as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
   application/postscript           application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
   application/vnd.cups-postscript  application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
</programlisting>

<para>
This would prevent all Postscript files from being filtered (rather, they will go
thru the virtual "nullfilter" denoted with "-"). This could only be useful for
PS printers. If you want to print PS code on non-PS printers an entry as follows
could be useful:
</para>

<programlisting>
   */*           application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
</programlisting>

<para>
and would effectively send *all* files to the backend without further processing.
</para>

<para>
Lastly, you could have the following entry:
</para>

<programlisting>
   application/vnd.cups-postscript  application/vnd.cups-raw  0  my_PJL_stripping_filter
</programlisting>

<para>
You will need to write a "my_PJL_stripping_filter" (could be a shellscript) that
parses the PostScript and removes the unwanted PJL. This would need to conform to
CUPS filter design (mainly, receive and pass the parameters printername, job-id,
username, jobtitle, copies, print options and possibly the filename). It would
be installed as world executable into "/usr/lib/cups/filters/" and will be called
by CUPS if it encounters a MIME type "application/vnd.cups-postscript".
</para>

<para>
CUPS can handle "-o job-hold-until=indefinite". This keeps the job in the queue
"on hold". It will only be printed upon manual release by the printer operator.
This is a requirement in many "central reproduction departments", where a few
operators manage the jobs of hundreds of users on some big machine, where no
user is allowed to have direct access. (The operators often need to load the
proper paper type before running the 10.000 page job requested by marketing
for the mailing, etc.).
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>CUPS as a network PostScript RIP</title>

<para>
This is the configuration where CUPS drivers are working on server, and where the
Adobe PostScript driver with CUPS-PPDs is downloaded to clients.
</para>

<para>
CUPS is perfectly able to use PPD files (PostScript
Printer Descriptions). PPDs can control all print device options. They
are usually provided by the manufacturer -- if you own a PostSript printer,
that is. PPD files are always a component of PostScript printer drivers on MS
Windows or Apple Mac OS systems. They are ASCII files containing
user-selectable print options, mapped to appropriate PostScript, PCL or PJL
commands for the target printer. Printer driver GUI dialogs translate these
options "on-the-fly" into buttons and drop-down lists for the user to
select.
</para>

<para>
CUPS can load, without any conversions, the PPD file from
any Windows (NT is recommended) PostScript driver and handle the options.
There is a web browser interface to the print options (select
http://localhost:631/printers/ and click on one "Configure Printer" button
to see it), a commandline interface (see <command>man lpoptions</command> or
try if you have <command>lphelp</command> on your system) plus some different GUI frontends on Linux
UNIX, which can present PPD options to the users. PPD options are normally
meant to become evaluated by the PostScript RIP on the real PostScript
printer.
</para>

<para>
CUPS doesn't stop at "real" PostScript printers in its
usage of PPDs. The CUPS developers have extended the PPD concept, to also
describe available device and driver options for non-PostScript printers
through  CUPS-PPDs.
</para>

<para>
This is logical, as CUPS includes a fully featured
PostScript interpreter (RIP). This RIP is based on Ghostscript. It can
process all received PostScript (and additionally many other file formats)
from clients. All CUPS-PPDs geared to non-PostScript printers contain an
additional line, starting with the keyword <parameter>*cupsFilter</parameter>.
This line
tells the CUPS print system which printer-specific filter to use for the
interpretation of the accompanying PostScript. Thus CUPS lets all its
printers appear as PostScript devices to its clients, because it can act as a
PostScript RIP for those printers, processing the received PostScript code
into a proper raster print format.
</para>

<para>
CUPS-PPDs can also be used on Windows-Clients, on top of a
PostScript driver (recommended is the Adobe one).
</para>

<para>
This feature enables CUPS to do a few tricks no other
spooler can do:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>act as a networked PostScript RIP (Raster Image Processor), handling
    printfiles from all client platforms in a uniform way;</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>act as a central accounting and billing server, as all files are passed
    through the <command>pstops</command> Filter and are therefor logged in
    the CUPS <filename>page&lowbar;log</filename>. - <emphasis>NOTE: </emphasis>this
    can not happen with "raw" print jobs, which always remain unfiltered
    per definition;</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>enable clients to consolidate on a single PostScript driver, even for
    many different target printers.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Windows Terminal Servers (WTS) as CUPS clients</title>

<para>
This setup may be of special interest to people
experiencing major problems in WTS environments. WTS need often a multitude
of non-PostScript drivers installed to run their clients' variety of
different printer models. This often imposes the price of much increased
instability. In many cases, in an attempt to overcome this problem, site
administrators have resorted to restrict the allowed drivers installed on
their WTS to one generic PCL- and one PostScript driver. This however
restricts the clients in the amount of printer options available for them --
often they can't get out more then simplex prints from one standard paper
tray, while their devices could do much better, if driven by a different
driver!
</para>

<para>
Using an Adobe PostScript driver, enabled with a CUPS-PPD,
seems to be a very elegant way to overcome all these shortcomings. The
PostScript driver is not known to cause major stability problems on WTS (even
if used with many different PPDs). The clients will be able to (again) chose
paper trays, duplex printing and other settings. However, there is a certain
price for this too: a  CUPS server acting as a PostScript RIP for its clients
requires more CPU and RAM than just to act as  a "raw spooling" device. Plus,
this setup is not yet widely tested, although the first feedbacks look very
promising...
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Setting up CUPS for driver download</title>

<para>
The <command>cupsadsmb</command> utility (shipped with all current
CUPS versions) makes the sharing of any (or all) installed CUPS printers very
easy. Prior to using it, you need the following settings in &smb.conf;:
</para>

	<para><programlisting>[global]
		 load printers = yes
		 printing = cups
		 printcap name = cups

	[printers]
		 comment = All Printers
		 path = /var/spool/samba
		 browseable = no
		 public = yes
		 guest ok = yes
		 writable = no
		 printable = yes
		 printer admin = root

	[print$]
		 comment = Printer Drivers
		 path = /etc/samba/drivers
		 browseable = yes
		 guest ok = no
		 read only = yes
		 write list = root
	</programlisting></para>

<para>
For licensing reasons the necessary files of the Adobe
Postscript driver can not be distributed with either Samba or CUPS. You need
to download them yourself from the Adobe website. Once extracted, create a
<filename>drivers</filename> directory in the CUPS data directory (usually
<filename>/usr/share/cups/</filename>). Copy the Adobe files using
UPPERCASE filenames, to this directory as follows:
</para>

	<para><programlisting>
		ADFONTS.MFM
		ADOBEPS4.DRV
		ADOBEPS4.HLP
		ADOBEPS5.DLL
		ADOBEPSU.DLL
		ADOBEPSU.HLP
		DEFPRTR2.PPD
		ICONLIB.DLL
	</programlisting></para>

<para>
Users of the ESP Print Pro software are able to install
their "Samba Drivers" package for this purpose with no problem.

</itemizedlist>

<para>
<emphasis>NOTE: </emphasis>the cupsomatic trick from Linuxprinting.org is
working different from the other drivers. While the other drivers take the
generic CUPS raster (produced by CUPS' own pstoraster PostScript RIP) as
their input, cupsomatic "kidnaps" the PostScript inside CUPS, before
RIP-ping, deviates it to an external Ghostscript installation (which now
becomes the RIP) and gives it back to a CUPS backend once Ghostscript is
finished. -- CUPS versions from 1.1.15 and later will provide their pstoraster
PostScript RIP function again inside a system-wide Ghostscript
installation rather than in "their own" pstoraster filter. (This
CUPS-enabling Ghostscript version may be installed either as a
patch to GNU or AFPL Ghostscript, or as a complete ESP Ghostscript package).
However, this will not change the cupsomatic approach of guiding the printjob
along a different path through the filtering system than the standard CUPS
way...

If you look closely, you'll discover your root password was transfered unencrypted over
the wire, so beware! Also, if you look further her, you'll discover error messages like
<constant>NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_COLLISION</constant> in between. They occur, because
the directories <filename>WIN40</filename> and <filename>W32X86</filename> already
existed in the [print$] driver download share (from a previous driver
installation). They are harmless here.

Now your printer is prepared for the clients to use. From
a client, browse to the CUPS/Samba server, open the "Printers"
share, right-click on this printer and select "Install..." or
"Connect..." (depending on the Windows version you use). Now their
should be a new printer in your client's local "Printers" folder,
named (in my case) "infotec_IS2027 on kdebitshop"

<command>cupsaddsmb</command> will only reliably work i
with CUPS version 1.1.15 or higher
and Samba from 2.2.4. If it doesn't work, or if the automatic printer
driver download to the clients doesn't succeed, you can still manually
install the CUPS printer PPD on top of the Adobe PostScript driver on
clients and then point the client's printer queue to the Samba printer
share for connection, should you desire to use the CUPS networked
PostScript RIP functions.

#       Note the difference to "cupsomatic", which will *not* output
#       CUPS-raster, but a final version of the printfile, ready to be

<title>CUPS Print Drivers and Devices</title>

<para>
CUPS ships with good support for HP LaserJet type printers. You can install
the driver as follows:

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	lpadmin -p laserjet4plus -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E -m laserjet.ppd
	</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

(The "-m" switch will retrieve the "laserjet.ppd" from the standard repository
for not-yet-installed-PPDs, which CUPS typically stores in 
<filename>/usr/share/cups/model</filename>. Alternatively, you may use
"-P /absolute/filesystem/path/to/where/there/is/PPD/your.ppd").
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Further printing steps</title>

<para>
Always also consult the database on linuxprinting.org for all recommendations
about which driver is best used for each printer:
</para>

<para><ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi">http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi</ulink></para>

<para>
There select your model and click on "Show". You'll arrive at a page listing
all drivers working with your model. There will always be *one* 
<emphasis>recommended</emphasis> one. Try this one first. In your case
("HP LaserJet 4 Plus"), you'll arrive here:
</para>

<para><ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=75104">http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=75104</ulink></para>

<para>
The recommended driver is "ljet4". It has a link to the page for the ljet4
driver too:
</para>

<para><ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_driver.cgi?driver=ljet4">http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_driver.cgi?driver=ljet4</ulink></para>

<para>
On the driver's page, you'll find important and detailed info about how to use
that driver within the various available spoolers. You can generate a PPD for
CUPS. The PPD contains all the info about how to use your model and the driver;
this is, once installed, working transparently for the user -- you'll only
need to choose resolution, paper size etc. from the web-based menu or from
the print dialog GUI or from the commandline...
</para>

<para>
On the driver's page, choose to use the "PPD-O-Matic" online PPD generator
program. Select your model and click "Generate PPD file". When you safe the
appearing ASCII text file, don't use "cut'n'past" (as it could possiblly corrupt
line endings and tabs), but use "Save as..." in your browser's menu. Save it
at "/some/path/on/your/filesystem/somewhere/my-name-for-my-printer.ppd"
</para>

<para>
Then install the printer:
</para>
<para><programlisting>
    "lpadmin -p laserjet4plus -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E \
          -P /some/path/on/your/filesystem/somewhere/my-name-for-my-printer.ppd"
</programlisting></para>

<para>
Note, that for all the "Foomatic-PPDs" from Linuxprinting.org, you also need
a special "CUPS filter" named "cupsomatic". Get the latest version of
"cupsomatic" from:
</para>

<para><ulink url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/cupsomatic">http://www.linuxprinting.org/cupsomatic</ulink></para>

<para>
This needs to be copied to <filename>/usr/lib/cups/filter/cupsomatic</filename>
and be made world executable. This filter is needed to read and act upon the
specially encoded Foomatic comments, embedded in the printfile, which in turn
are used to construct (transparently for you, the user) the complicated
ghostscript command line needed for your printer/driver combo.
</para>

<para>
You can have a look at all the options for the Ghostscript commandline supported
by your printer and the ljet4 driver by going to the section "Execution details",
selecting your model (Laserjet 4 Plus) and clicking on "Show execution details".
This will bring up this web page:

<para>
The ingenious thing is that the database is kept current. If there
is a bug fix and an improvement somewhere in the database, you will
always get the most current and stable and feature-rich driver by following
the steps described above.

<note><para>
Till Kamppeter from MandrakeSoft is doing an excellent job here that too few
people are aware of. (So if you use it often, please send him a note showing
your appreciation).</para></note>

<para>
The latest and greatest improvement now is support for "custom page sizes"
for all those printers which support it.
</para>

<para>
"cupsomatic" is documented here:

<para>
Note, that *all* the Foomatic drivers listed on Linuxprinting.org (now
approaching the "all-time high" number of 1.000 for the supported models)
are using a special filtering chain involving Ghostscript, as described
in this document.

Summary - You need:
</para>

<para>
<simplelist>
	<member>A "foomatic+<replaceable>something</replaceable>" PPD is not enough to print with CUPS (but it is *one* important component)</member>
	<member>The "cupsomatic" filter script (Perl) in <filename>/usr/lib/cups/filters/</filename></member>
	<member>Perl to make cupsomatic run</member>
	<member>Ghostscript (because it is called and controlled by the PPD/cupsomatic combo in a way to fit your printermodel/driver combo.</member>
	<member>Ghostscript *must*, depending on the driver/model, contain support for a certain "device" (as shown by "gs -h")</member>
</simplelist>
</para>

<para>
In the case of the "hpijs" driver, you need a Ghostscript version, which
has "ijs" amongst its supported devices in "gs -h". In the case of
"hpijs+foomatic", a valid ghostscript commandline would be reading like this:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
       gs -q -dBATCH -dPARANOIDSAFER -dQUIET -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=ijs       \
             -sIjsServer=hpijs<replaceable>PageSize</replaceable> -dDuplex=<replaceable>Duplex</replaceable> <replaceable>Model</replaceable>        \

             -sOutputFile=- -
</programlisting></para>

<note><para>
Note, that with CUPS and the "hpijs+foomatic" PPD (plus Perl and cupsomatic)
you don't need to remember this. You can choose the available print options
thru a GUI print command (like "glp" from ESP's commercially supported
PrintPro software, or KDE's "kprinter", or GNOME's "gtklp" or the independent
"xpp") or the CUPS web interface via human-readable drop-down selection
menus.
</para></note>

<para>
If you use "ESP Ghostscript" (also under the GPL, provided by Easy Software
Products, the makers of CUPS, downloadable from
<ulink url="http://www.cups.org/software.html">http://www.cups.org/software.html</ulink>,
co-maintained by the developers of linuxprinting.org), you are guaranteed to
have in use the most uptodate, bug-fixed, enhanced and stable version of a Free
Ghostscript. It contains support for ~300 devices, whereas plain vanilla
GNU Ghostscript 7.05 only has ~200.
</para>

<para>
If you print only one CUPS test page, from the web interface and when you try to

</simplelist>

You can try to get a more detailed debugging info by setting "LogLevel debug" in
<filename>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</filename>, re-start cupsd and investigate <filename>/var/log/cups/error_log</filename>
for the whereabouts of your Windows-originating printjobs:

<sect1>
<title>Limiting the number of pages users can print</title>

<para>
The feature you want is dependent on the real print subsystem you're using.
Samba's part is always to receive the job files from the clients (filtered
*or* unfiltered) and hand it over to this printing subsystem.
</para>

<para>
Of course one could "hack" things with one's own scripts.
</para>

<para>
But there is CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). CUPS supports "quotas".
Quotas can be based on sizes of jobs or on the number of pages or both,
and are spanning any time period you want.
</para>

<para>
This is an example command how root would set a print quota in CUPS,
assuming an existing printer named "quotaprinter":
</para>

<programlisting>
  lpadmin -p quotaprinter -o job-quota-period=604800 -o job-k-limit=1024 \
       -o job-page-limit=100
</programlisting>

<para>
This would limit every single user to print 100 pages or 1024 KB of
data (whichever comes first) within the last 604.800 seconds ( = 1 week).
</para>

<para>
For CUPS to count correctly, the printfile needs to pass the CUPS "pstops" filter,
otherwise it uses a "dummy" count of "1". Some printfiles don't pass it
(eg: image files) but then those are mostly 1 page jobs anyway. This also means,
proprietary drivers for the target printer running on the client computers and
CUPS/Samba then spooling these files as "raw" (i.e. leaving them untouched, not
filtering them), will be counted as "1-pagers" too!
</para>

<para>
You need to send PostScript from the clients (i.e. run a PostScript driver there)
for having the chance to get accounting done. If the printer is a non-PostScript model,
you need to let CUPS do the job to convert the file to a print-ready format for the
target printer. This will be working for currently ~1.000 different printer models, see
</para>

<programlisting>
     http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi
</programlisting>

<para>
Before CUPS-1.1.16 your only option was to use the Adobe PostScript
Driver on the Windows clients. The output of this driver was not always
passed thru the "pstops" filter on the CUPS/Samba side, and therefor was
not counted correctly (the reason is that it often --- depending on the
"PPD" being used --- did write a "PJL"-header in front of the real
PostScript which made CUPS to skip the pstops and go directy to
the "pstoraster" stage).
</para>

<para>
From CUPS-1.1.16 onward you can use the "CUPS PostScript Driver
for Windows NT/2K/XP clients" (it is tagged in the download area of
http://www.cups.org/ as the "cups-samba-1.1.16.tar.gz" package).
It is *not* working for Win9x/ME clients. But it:
</para>

<simplelist>
	<member>it guarantees to not write an PJL-header</member>
	<member>it guarantees to still read and support all PJL-options named in the driver PPD with its own means</member>
	<member>it guarantees the file going thru the "pstops" filter on the CUPS/Samba server</member>
	<member>it guarantees to page-count correctly the printfile</member>
</simplelist>

<para>
You can read more about the setup of this combination in the
manpage for "cupsaddsmb" (only present with CUPS installed, only
current with CUPS 1.1.16).
</para>

<para>
These are the items CUPS logs in the "page_log" for every single *page* of a job:

What flaws or shortcomings are there?
</para>

<simplelist>
	<member>the ones named above</member>

	<member>
	CUPS really counts the job pages being *processsed in software*
	(going thru the "RIP") rather than the physical sheets successfully
	leaving the printing device -- if there is a jam while printing
	the 5th sheet out of 1000 and the job is aborted by the printer,
	the "page count" will still show the figure of 1000 for that job
	</member>

	<member>
	all quotas are the same for all users (no flexibility to give the
	boss a higher quota than the clerk) no support for groups
	</member>

	<member>
	no means to read out the current balance or "used-up" number of current quota
	</member>

	<member>
	a user having used up 99 sheets of 100 quota will still be able to send and print a 1.000 sheet job
	</member>

	<member>
	a user being denied a job because of a filled-up quota doesn't get a meaningful
	error message from CUPS other than "client-error-not-possible".
	</member>
</simplelist>

<para>
But this is the best system out there currently. And there are
huge improvements under development:
</para>

<simplelist>
	<member>page counting will go into the "backends" (these talk
	directly to the printer and will increase the count in sync with the
	 actual printing process -- a jam at the 5th sheet will lead to a stop in the counting)</member>

	<member>quotas will be handled more flexibly</member>

	<member>probably there will be support for users to inquire their "accounts" in advance</member>

	<member>probably there will be support for some other tools around this topic</member>
</simplelist>

<para>
Other than the current stage of the CUPS development, I don't
know any other ready-to-use tool which you could consider.
</para>

<para>
You can download the driver files from
<ulink url="http://www.cups.org/software.html">http://www.cups.org/software.html</ulink>.
It is a separate package from the CUPS base software files, tagged as "CUPS 1.1.16
Windows NT/2k/XP Printer Driver for SAMBA (tar.gz, 192k)". The filename to
download is "cups-samba-1.1.16.tar.gz". Upon untar-/unzip-ping it will reveal
the files:
</para>

   cups-samba.license
   cups-samba.readme
   cups-samba.remove
   cups-samba.ss
</computeroutput>
</para>

<para>
These have been packaged with the ESP meta packager software "EPM". The
*.install and *.remove files are simple shell script, which untars the
*.ss (which is nothing else than a tar-archive) and puts its contents
into <filename>/usr/share/cups/drivers/</filename>. Its contents are 3 files:
</para>

<para>
<computeroutput>
   cupsdrvr.dll
   cupsui.dll
   cups.hlp

</para>

<caution><para>
Due to a bug one CUPS release puts the <filename>cups.hlp</filename>
into <filename>/usr/share/drivers/</filename> instead of
<filename>/usr/share/cups/drivers/</filename>. To work around this, copy/move
the file after running the "./cups-samba.install" script manually to the right place:
</para>

	<para>
<userinput> cp /usr/share/drivers/cups.hlp /usr/share/cups/drivers/
</userinput>
	</para></caution>

<note>
<para>
This new CUPS PostScript driver is currently binary-only, but free
no source code is provided (yet). The reason is this: it has
been developed with the help of the Microsoft Driver Developer Kit (DDK)
and compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 6. It is not clear to the driver
developers if they are allowed to distribute the whole of the source code
as Free Software. However, they will likely release the "diff" in source
code under the GPL, so anybody with a license of Visual Studio and a DDK
will be able to compile for him/herself.
</para>

<para>
Once you have run the install script (and possibly manually moved the
"cups.hlp" file to "/usr/share/cups/drivers/"), the driver is ready to be
put into Samba's [print$] share (which often maps to "/etc/samba/drivers/"
and contains a subdir tree with WIN40 and W32X86 branches), by running
"cupsaddsmb" (see also "man cupsaddsmb" for CUPS 1.1.16). [Don't forget to
put root into the smbpasswd file by running "smbpasswd" should you run
this whole procedure for the first time.] Once the driver files are in the
[print$] share, they are ready to be downloaded and installed by the
Win NT/2k/XP clients.
</para></note>


	<note><para>
	Win 9x/ME clients won't work with this driver. For these you'd
	still need to use the ADOBE*.* drivers as previously.
	</para></note>

	<note><para>
	It is not harming if you've still the ADOBE*.* driver files from
	previous installations in the "/usr/share/cups/drivers/" directory.
	The new cupsaddsmb (from 1.1.16) will automatically use the
	"newest" installed driver (which here then is the CUPS drivers).
	</para></note>

	<note><para>
	Should your Win clients have had the old ADOBE*.* files and the
	Adobe PostScript drivers installed, the download and installation
	of the new CUPS PostScript driver for Windows NT/2k/XP will fail
	at first.
	</para>
	<para>
	It is not enough to "delete" the printer (as the driver files
	will still be kept by the clients and re-used if you try to
	re-install the printer). To really get rid of the Adobe driver
	files on the clients, open the "Printers" folder (possibly via
	"Start --> Settings --> Control Panel --> Printers"), right-click
	onto the folder background and select "Server Properties". A
	new dialog opens; select the "Drivers" tab; on the list select
	the driver you want to delete and click on the "Delete" button.
	(This will only work if there is no single printer left which
	uses that particular driver -- you need to "delete" all printers
	using this driver in the "Printers" folder first.)
	</para>
	</note>

	<note><para>
	Once you have successfully downloaded the CUPS PostScript driver
	to a client, you can easily switch all printers to this one
	by proceeding as described elsewhere in the "Samba HOWTO
	Collection" to change a driver for an existing printer.

	<member><para>
	the Adobe drivers (depending on the printer PPD associated with them)

	file (thus the file starts with "<replaceable>1B</replaceable>%-12345X"
	or "<replaceable>escape</replaceable>%-12345X"
	instead of "%!PS"). This leads to the CUPS daemon autotyping the
	arriving file as a print-ready file, not requiring a pass thru the
	"pstops" filter (to speak more technical, it is not regarded as the
	generic MIME type "application/postscript", but as the more special
	MIME type "application/cups.vnd-postscript"), which therefore also
	leads to the page accounting in "/var/log/cups/page_log" not receiving
	the exact mumber of pages; instead the dummy page number of "1" is
	logged in a standard setup)
	</para></member>

	<member><para>
	the Adobe driver has more options to "mis-configure" the PostScript

Now if you are afraid that this would just mean using a *Generic* PostScript

choice, but you need them to be able to set up print jobs, with all the bells
and whistles of your printers:-

</simplelist>

<para>
CUPS PPDs are working perfectly on Windows clients who use Adobe PostScript
drivers (or the new CUPS PostScript driver for Windows NT/2K/XP). Clients can use
them to setup the job to their liking and CUPS will use the received job options
to make the (PCL-, ESC/P- or PostScript-) printer behave as required.
</para>

<para>
If you want to have the additional benefit of page count logging and accounting
then the CUPS PostScript driver is the best choice (better than the Adobe one).
</para>

<para>
If you want to make the drivers downloadable for the clients then "cupsaddsmb" is
your friend. It will setup the [print$] share on the Samba host to be ready to serve
the clients for a "point and print" driver installation.

There are some. But, given the sheer CPU power you can buy nowadays,
these can be overcome easily. The strings:

<para>
Well, if the CUPS/Samba side will have to print to many printers serving many users,
you probably will need to set up a second server (which can do automatic load balancing
with the first one, plus a degree of fail-over mechanism). Converting the incoming
PostScript jobs, "interpreting" them for non-PostScript printers, amounts to the work
of a "RIP" (Raster Image Processor) done in software. This requires more CPU and RAM
than for the mere "raw spooling" task your current setup is solving. It all depends
on the avarage and peak printing load the server should be able to handle.

<title>Auto-Deletion of CUPS spool files</title>

<para>
Samba print files pass thru two "spool" directories. One the incoming directory
managed by Samba, (set eg: in the <command>path = /var/spool/samba</command> directive in the [printers]
section of &smb.conf;). Second is the spool directory of your UNIX print subsystem.
For CUPS it is normally "/var/spool/cups/", as set by the cupsd.conf directive
"RequestRoot /var/spool/cups".
</para>

<para>
I am not sure, which one of your directories keeps the files.  From what you say,
it is most likely the Samba part.

old-fashioned BSD-LPD control files). This is set to "Yes"
as a default.
</para>

<para>
"PreserveJobFiles Yes" -- keeps the job files themselves in
cupsd's mind (well it keeps the "d12345", "d12346" etc. files
in the CUPS spool directory...). This is set to "No" as the
CUPS default.
</para>

<para>
"MaxJobs 500" -- this directive controls the maximum number
of jobs that are kept in memory. Once the number of jobs
reaches the limit, the oldest completed job is automatically
purged from the system to make room for the new one. If all
of the known jobs are still pending or active then the new
job will be rejected. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this
functionality. The default setting is 0.
</para>

<para>
(There are also additional settings for "MaxJobsPerUser" and
"MaxJobsPerPrinter"...)
</para>

<para>
For everything to work as announced, you need to have three things:
</para>

<simplelist>

	<member>
	a Samba-&smbd; which is compiled against "libcups" (Check on Linux by running <userinput>ldd `which smbd`</userinput>)
	</member>

	<member>
	a Samba-&smb.conf; setting of <command>printing = cups</command>
	</member>

	<member>
	another Samba-&smb.conf; setting of <command>printcap = cups</command>
	</member>

</simplelist>

<note><para>
Note, that in this case all other manually set printing-related
commands (like "print command", "lpq command", "lprm command",
"lppause command" or "lpresume command") are ignored and they
should normally have no influence what-so-ever on your printing.
</para></note>

<para>
If you want to do things manually, replace the "printing = cups"
by "printing = bsd". Then your manually set commands may work
(haven't tested this), and a "print command = lp -d %P %s; rm %s"
may do what you need.
</para>

<para>
You forgot to mention the CUPS version you're using. If you did
set things up as described in the man pages, then the Samba
spool files should be deleted. Otherwise it may be a bug. On
the CUPS side, you can control the behaviour as described
above.
</para>

<para>
If you have more problems, post the output of these commands:
</para>

<para>
<userinput>
   grep -v ^# /etc/cups/cupsd.conf | grep -v ^$
   grep -v ^# /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -v ^$ | grep -v "^;"
</userinput>
</para>

<para>
(adapt paths as needed). These commands sanitize the files
and cut out the empty lines and lines with comments, providing
the "naked settings" in a compact way.
</para>
