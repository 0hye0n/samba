<title>Storing Samba's User/Machine Account information in an LDAP Directory</title>

<sect1>
<title>Purpose</title>

<para>
This document describes how to use an LDAP directory for storing Samba user
account information normally stored in the smbpasswd(5) file.  It is
assumed that the reader already has a basic understanding of LDAP concepts
and has a working directory server already installed.  For more information
on LDAP architectures and Directories, please refer to the following sites.

<sect1>
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
Traditionally, when configuring <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#ENCRYPTPASSWORDS">"encrypt
passwords = yes"</ulink> in Samba's <filename>smb.conf</filename> file, user account
information such as username, LM/NT password hashes, password change times, and account
flags have been stored in the <filename>smbpasswd(5)</filename> file.  There are several
disadvantages to this approach for sites with very large numbers of users (counted
in the thousands).
</para>

<para>
The first is that all lookups must be performed sequentially.  Given that
there are approximately two lookups per domain logon (one for a normal
session connection such as when mapping a network drive or printer), this
is non-optimal.  What is needed is an indexed approach such as is used in
databases.
</para>

<para>
The second problem is that administrators which desired to replicate an
smbpasswd file to more than one Samba server were left to use external
tools such as <command>rsync(1)</command> and <command>ssh(1)</command>
and write custom, in-house scripts.
</para>

<para>
And finally, the amount of information which is stored in an
smbpasswd entry leaves no room for additional attributes such as
a home directory, password expiration time, or even a Relative
Identified (RID).
</para>

<para>
As a result of these defeciencies, a more robust means of storing user attributes
used by smbd was developed.  The API which defines access to user accounts
is referred to as the samdb interface (previously this was called the passdb
API, and is still so named in the CVS trees).  In Samba 2.2.3, enabling support
for a samdb backend (e.g. <parameter>--with-ldapsam</parameter> or
<parameter>--with-tdbsam</parameter>) requires compile time support.
</para>

<para>
When compiling Samba to include the <parameter>--with-ldapsam</parameter> autoconf
option, smbd (and associated tools) will store and lookup user accounts in
an LDAP directory.  In reality, this is very easy to understand.  If you are
comfortable with using an smbpasswd file, simply replace "smbpasswd" with
"LDAP directory" in all the documentation.
</para>

<para>
There are a few points to stress about what the <parameter>--with-ldapsam</parameter>
does not provide.  The LDAP support referred to in the this documentat does not
include:

	an Windows 2000 Active Directory server.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>A means of replacing /etc/passwd.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The second item can be accomplished by using LDAP NSS and PAM modules.  LGPL
versions of these libraries can be obtained from PADL Software
(<ulink url="http://www.padl.com/">http://www.padl.com/</ulink>).  However,
the details of configuring these packages i beyond the scope of this document.

<title>Supported LDAP Servers</title>

<para>
The LDAP samdb code in 2.2.3 has been developed and tested using the OpenLDAP
2.0 server and client libraries.  The same code should be able to work with
Netscape's Directory Server and client SDK. However, due to lack of testing
so far, there are bounds to be compile errors and bugs.  These should not be
hard to fix. If you are so inclined, please be sure to forward all pacthes to
<ulink url="samba-patches@samba.org">samba-patches@samba.org</ulink> and
<ulink url="jerry@samba.org">jerry@samba.org</ulink>.

<sect1>
<title>Schema and Relationship to the RFC 2307 posixAccount</title>


<para>
Samba 2.2.3 includes the necessary schema file for OpenLDAP 2.0 in
<filename>examples/LDAP/samba.schema</filename>.  (Note that this schema
file has been modified since the experimental support initially included
in 2.2.2).  The sambaAccount objectclass is given here:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
objectclass ( 1.3.1.5.1.4.1.7165.2.2.2 NAME 'sambaAccount' SUP top STRUCTURAL
     DESC 'Samba Account'
     MUST ( uid $ rid )
     MAY  ( cn $ lmPassword $ ntPassword $ pwdLastSet $ logonTime $
            logoffTime $ kickoffTime $ pwdCanChange $ pwdMustChange $ acctFlags $
            displayName $ smbHome $ homeDrive $ scriptPath $ profilePath $
            description $ userWorkstations $ primaryGroupID ))
</programlisting></para>

<para>
The samba.schema file has been formatted for OpenLDAP 2.0.  The OID's are
owned by the Samba Team and as such as legal to be openly published.
If you translate the schema to be used with Netscape DS, please
submit the modified schema file as a patch to <ulink
url="jerry@samba.org">jerry@samba.org</ulink>
</para>

<para>
Just as the smbpasswd file is mean to store information which supplements a
user's <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entry, so is the sambaAccount object
meant to supplement the UNIX user account information.  A sambaAccount is a
<constant>STRUCTURAL</constant> objectclass so it can be stored individually
in the directory.  However, there are several fields (e.g. uid) which overlap
with the posixAccount objectclass outlined in RFC2307.  This is by design.
</para>

<para>
In order to store all user account information (UNIX and Samba) in the directory,
it is necessary to use the sambaAccount and posixAccount objectclasses in
combination.  However, smbd will still obtain the user's UNIX account
information via the standard C library calls (e.g. getpwnam(), et. al.).
This means that the Samba server must also have the LDAP NSS library installed
and functioning correctly.  This division of information mkes it posible to
store all Samba account information in LDAP, but still maintain UNIX account
information in NIS while the network is transitioning to a full LDAP infratrsucture.
</para>

<para>
To include support for the sambaAccount object in an OpenLDAP directory
server, first copy the samba.schema file to slapd's configuration directory.
</para>

<para>
<prompt>root# </prompt><command>cp samba.schema /etc/openldap/schema/</command>
</para>

<para>
Next, include the <filename>samba.schema</filename> file in <filename>slapd.conf</filename>.
The sambaAccount object contains two attributes which depend upon other schema
files.  The 'uid' attribute is defined in <filename>cosine.schema</filename> and
the 'displayName' attribute is defined in the <filename>inetorgperson.schema</filename>
file.  Bother of these must be included before the <filename>samba.schema</filename> file.
</para>

<para><programlisting>
## /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

## schema files (core.schema is required by default)
include	           /etc/openldap/schema/core.schema

## needed for sambaAccount
include            /etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
include            /etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
include            /etc/openldap/schema/samba.schema

## uncomment this line if you want to support the RFC2307 (NIS) schema
## include         /etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema

....

<title>smb.conf LDAP parameters</title>


<para>
The following parameters are available in smb.conf only with <parameter>--with-ldapsam</parameter>
was included with compiling Samba.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#LDAPSSL">ldap ssl</ulink></para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#LDAPSERVER">ldap server</ulink></para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#LDAPADMINDN">ldap admin dn</ulink></para></listitem>

	<listitem><para><ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#LDAPPORT">ldap port</ulink></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
These are described in the <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf(5)</ulink> man
page and so will not be repeated here.  However, a sample smb.conf file for
use with an LDAP directory could appear as
</para>

<para><programlisting>
## /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
[global]
     security = user
     encrypt passwords = yes

     netbios name = TASHTEGO
     workgroup = NARNIA

     # ldap related parameters

     # define the DN to use when binding to the directory servers
     # The password for this DN is not stored in smb.conf.  Rather it
     # must be set by using 'smbpasswd -w <replaceable>secretpw</replaceable>' to store the
     # passphrase in the secrets.tdb file.  If the "ldap admin dn" values
     # changes, this password will need to be reset.
     ldap admin dn = "cn=Manager,dc=samba,dc=org"

     #  specify the LDAP server's hostname (defaults to locahost)
     ldap server = ahab.samba.org

     # Define the SSL option when connecting to the directory
     # ('off', 'start tls', or 'on' (default))
     ldap ssl = start tls

     # define the port to use in the LDAP session (defaults to 636 when
     # "ldap ssl = on")
     ldap port = 389

     # specify the base DN to use when searching the directory
     ldap suffix = "ou=people,dc=samba,dc=org"

     # generally the default ldap search filter is ok
     # ldap filter = "(&(uid=%u)(objectclass=sambaAccount))"
</programlisting></para>



</sect1>




<sect1>
<title>Security and sambaAccount</title>


<para>
There are two important points to remember when discussing the security
of sambaAccount entries in the directory.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><emphasis>Never</emphasis> retrieve the lmPassword or
	ntPassword attribute values over and unencrypted LDAP session.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><emphasis>Never</emphasis> allow non-admin users to
	view the lmPassword or ntPassword attribute values.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
These password hashes are clear text equivalents and can be used to impersonate
the user without deriving the original clear text strings.
</para>

<para>
To remedy the first security issue, the "ldap ssl" smb.conf parameter defaults
to require an encrypted session (<command>ldap ssl = on</command>) using
the default port of 636
when contacting the directory server.  When using an OpenLDAP 2.0 server, it
is possible to use the use the StartTLS LDAP extended  operation in the place of
LDAPS.  In either case, you are strongly discouraged to disable this security
(<command>ldap ssl = off</command>).
</para>

<para>
The second security precaution is to prevent non-administrative users from
harvesting password hashes from the directory.  This can be done using the
following ACL in <filename>slapd.conf</filename>:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
## allow users to update their own password, but not to browse others
access to attrs=userPassword,lmPassword,ntPassword
     by self write
     by * auth
</programlisting></para>

<para>
You may of course, add in write access to administrative DN's as necessary.
</para>

</sect1>



<sect1>
<title></title>


<para>
There are currently four sambaAccount attributes which map directly onto
<filename>smb.conf</filename> parameters.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>smbHome -&gt; "logon home"</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>profilePath -&gt; "logon path"</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>homeDrive -&gt; "logon drive"</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>scriptPath -&gt; "logon script"</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
First of all, these parameters are only used when Samba is acting as a
PDC or a domain (refer to the <ulink url="Samba-PDC-HOWTO.html">Samba-PDC-HOWTO</ulink>
for details on how to configure Samba as a Primary Domain Controller).
Furthermore, these attributes are only stored with the sambaAccount entry if
the values are non-default values.  For example, assume TASHTEGO has now been
configured as a PDC and that <command>logon home = \\%L\%u</command> was defined in
its <filename>smb.conf</filename> file.  Assuming <filename>smb.conf</filename>
also contains , when a user named "becky" logons to the domain, the <parameter>logon
home</parameter> string is expanded to \\TASHTEGO\becky.
</para>

<para>
If the smbHome attribute exists in the entry "uid=becky,ou=people,dc=samba,dc=org",
this value is used.  However, if this attribute does not exist, then the value
of the <parameter>logon home</parameter> parameter is used in its place.  Samba
will only write the attribute value to the directory entry is the value is
something other than the default (e.g. \\MOBY\becky).
</para>
