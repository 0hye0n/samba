		<listitem><para>Normally, Samba validates each entry
		in the LDAP server against getpwnam().  This allows
		LDAP to be used for Samba with the unix system using
		NIS (for example) and also ensures that Samba does not
		present accounts that do not otherwise exist.  </para>
	        <para>This option is used to disable this functionality, and
		instead to rely on the presence of the appropriate
		attributes in LDAP directly, which can result in a
		significant performance boost in some situations.  
                Setting this option to yes effectivly assumes
		that the local machine is running <command moreinfo="none">nss_ldap</command> against the
		same LDAP server.</para>
