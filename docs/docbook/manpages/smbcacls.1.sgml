Synopsis
smbcacls
//server/share filename [-U username] [-A acls] [-M acls]  [-D acls] [-S acls]
 [-C name] [-G name] [-n] [-h] 
Description
The smbcacls program manipulates
NT Access Control Lists (ACLs) on SMB file shares. 
Options
The following
options are available to the smbcacls program.  The format of ACLs is described
in the section ACL FORMAT 
-A aclsAdd the ACLs specified to the ACL list.
 Existing access control entries are unchanged. -M aclsModify the mask value
(permissions) for the ACLs specified on the command line.  An error will
be printed for each ACL specified that was not already present in the ACL
list. -D aclsDelete any ACLs specfied on the command line.  An error will
be printed for each ACL specified that was not already present in the ACL
list. -S aclsThis command sets the ACLs on the file with only the ones specified
on the command line.  All other ACLs are erased.  Note that the ACL specified
must contain at least a revision, type, owner and group for the call to
succeed. -U usernameSpecifies a username used to connect to the specified
service.  The username may be of the form CWusername in which case the user
is prompted to enter in a password and the workgroup specified in the smb.conf
file is used, or CWusername%password or CWDOMAIN\username%password and the
password and workgroup names are used as provided. -C nameThe owner of a
file or directory can be changed to the name given using the -C option. 
The name can be a sid in the form CWS-1-x-y-z or a name resolved against the
server specified in the first argument. This command is a shortcut for CW-M
OWNER:name. -G nameThe group owner of a file or directory can be changed
to the name given using the -G option.  The name can be a sid in the form
CWS-1-x-y-z or a name resolved against the server specified in the first argument.
This command is a shortcut for CW-M GROUP:name. -nThis option displays all
ACL information in numeric format.  The default is to convert SIDs to names
and ACE types and masks to a readable string format.  -hPrint usage information
on the smbcacls program 
Acl Format
The format of an ACL is one or more ACL
entries separated by either  commas or newlines.  An ACL entry is one of
the following: 

 
 
REVISION:<revision number>
OWNER:<sid or name>
GROUP:<sid or name>
ACL:<sid or name>:<type>/<flags>/<mask>
 
 
 
The revision of the ACL specifies the internal Windows NT ACL revision
for the security descriptor.  If not specified it defaults to 1.  Using values
other than 1 may cause strange behaviour. 
The owner and group specify the
owner and group sids for the object.  If a SID in the format CWS-1-x-y-z is
specified this is used, otherwise the name specified is resolved using
the server on which the file or directory resides. 
ACLs specify permissions
granted to the SID.  This SID again can be specified in CWS-1-x-y-z format or
as a name in which case it is resolved against the server on which the
file or directory resides.  The type, flags and mask values determine the
type of access granted to the SID. 
The type can be either 0 or 1 corresponding
to ALLOWED or DENIED access to the SID.  The flags values are generally
zero for file ACLs and either 9 or 2 for directory ACLs.  Some common flags
are: 

 
 
#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_OBJECT_INHERIT     	0x1
#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_CONTAINER_INHERIT  	0x2
#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT       0x4
#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_INHERIT_ONLY       	0x8
 
 
 
At present flags can only be specified as decimal or hexadecimal values.
 
The mask is a value which expresses the access right granted to the SID.
It can be given as a decimal or hexadecimal value, or by using one of the
following text strings which map to the NT file permissions of the same
name. 
CWR 	Allow read access CWW 	Allow write access CWX 	Execute permission
on the object CWD 	Delete the object CWP 	Change permissions CWO	Take ownership

The following combined permissions can be specified: 
CWREAD	  Equivalent
to CWRX permissions CWCHANGE  Equivalent to CWRXWD permissions CWFULL 
  Equivalent to CWRWXDPO permissions 
Exit Status
The smbcacls program sets
the exit status depending on the success or otherwise of the operations
performed.  The exit status may be one of the following values. 
If the operation
succeded, smbcacls returns and exit status of 0.  If smbcacls couldn't connect
to the specified server, or there was an error getting or setting the ACLs,
an exit status of 1 is returned.  If there was an error parsing any command
line arguments, an exit status of 2 is returned.
