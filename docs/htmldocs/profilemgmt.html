Windows 9x / Me and Windows NT4/200x clients implement these features.</P

profiles location. However, the response does not have room for a separate
profiles location field, only the user's home share. This means that Win9X/Me
profiles are restricted to being stored in the user's home directory.</P

Desktop profiles are an evolving phenomenon and profiles for later versions

of profile contents may overwrite information that belongs to the newer
version resulting in loss of profile information content when that user logs
