>Version of Samba prior to release 2.2 had marginal capabilities to
act as a Windows NT 4.0 Primary Domain Controller (PDC).  Beginning with 
Samba 2.2.0, we are proud to announce official support for Windows NT 4.0 
style domain logons from Windows NT 4.0 (through SP6) and Windows 2000 (through 
SP1) clients.  This article outlines the steps necessary for configuring Samba 
as a PDC.  It is necessary to have a working Samba server prior to implementing the 
PDC functionality.  If you have not followed the steps outlined in

>Creating Machine Trust Accounts and Joining Clients 
to the Domain</A
></H1
><P
>A machine trust account is a samba user account owned by a computer.  
The account password acts as the shared secret for secure 
communication with the Domain Controller.  This is a security feature
to prevent an unauthorized machine with the same NetBIOS name from 
joining the domain and gaining access to domain user/group accounts.  
Hence a Windows 9x host is never a true member of a domain because it does 
not posses a machine trust account, and thus has no shared secret with the DC.</P
><P
>On a Windows NT PDC, these machine trust account passwords are stored
in the registry.  A Samba PDC stores these accounts in the same location
as user LanMan and NT password hashes (currently <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smbpasswd</TT
>).
However, machine trust accounts only possess and use the NT password hash.</P
><P
>Because Samba requires machine accounts to possess a UNIX uid from
which an Windows NT SID can be generated, all of these accounts
must have an entry in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> and smbpasswd.  
Future releases will alleviate the need to create 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> entries.  </P
><P

><P
>	Creation of the account at the time of joining the domain.  In 
	this case, the session key of the administrative account used to join

the NetBIOS name of the pc to be added to the domain.  The "$" must append the NetBIOS
name of the pc or samba will not recognize this as a machine account</P
><P

	</P
><P
>	One of the best diagnostic tools for debugging problems is Samba itself.  
	You can use the -d option for both smbd and nmbd to specify what 
	'debug level' at which to run.  See the man pages on smbd, nmbd  and 
	smb.conf for more information on debugging options.  The debug 
	level can range from 1 (the default) to 10 (100 for debugging passwords).
	</P
><P
>	Another helpful method of debugging is to compile samba using the 
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc -g </B
> flag.   This will include debug 
	information in the binaries and allow you to attach gdb to the 
	running smbd / nmbd process.  In order to attach gdb to an smbd 
	process for an NT workstation, first get the workstation to make the 
	connection. Pressing ctrl-alt-delete and going down to the domain box 
	is sufficient (at least, on the first time you join the domain) to 
	generate a 'LsaEnumTrustedDomains'. Thereafter, the workstation 
	maintains an open connection, and therefore there will be an smbd 
	process running (assuming that you haven't set a really short smbd 
	idle timeout)  So, in between pressing ctrl alt delete, and actually 
	typing in your password, you can gdb attach and continue.

Edition, Using Samba. (Richard Sharpe)</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></DIV
><P
>A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same thing in terms of network
browsing.  The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network.  Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server (NT server and 
other systems based on NT server support this, as does at least Samba TNG now).</P
><P
>The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is
identical and is explained in BROWSING.txt. It should be noted, that browsing
is total orthogonal to logon support.</P
><P
>Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
document.  Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts, and user
profiles for MS Windows for workgroups and MS Windows 9X clients.</P
><P
>When an SMB client in a domain wishes to logon it broadcast requests for a
logon server.  The first one to reply gets the job, and validates its
password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but very stupid) to create a domain where the user
database is not shared between servers, i.e. they are effectively workgroup
servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain.  This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely
involved with domains.</P
><P
>Another thing commonly associated with single-logon domains is remote
administration over the SMB protocol.  Again, there is no reason why this
cannot be implemented with an underlying username database which is
different from the Windows NT SAM.  Support for the Remote Administration
Protocol is planned for a future release of Samba.</P
><P
>Network logon support as discussed in this section is aimed at Window for
Workgroups, and Windows 9X clients. </P
><P
>Support for profiles is confirmed as working for Win95, NT 4.0 and NT 3.51.
It is possible to specify: the profile location; script file to be loaded
on login; the user's home directory; and for NT a kick-off time could also
now easily be supported. However, there are some differences between Win9X
profile support and WinNT profile support. These are discussed below.</P
><P
>With NT Workstations, all this does not require the use or intervention of
an NT 4.0 or NT 3.51 server: Samba can now replace the logon services
provided by an NT server, to a limited and experimental degree (for example,
running "User Manager for Domains" will not provide you with access to
a domain created by a Samba Server).</P
><P
>With Win95, the help of an NT server can be enlisted, both for profile storage
and for user authentication.  For details on user authentication, see
security_level.txt.  For details on profile storage, see below.</P
><P
>Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server; make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.</P
><P
>Before launching into the configuration instructions, it is worthwhile looking
at how a Win9X client performs a logon:</P
><P

><P
>	The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
	a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS address DOMAIN&#60;00&#62; at the

	contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
	\\SERVER.

which  will not work due to technical reasons is <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"

mode security.  <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>DOMAIN</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>SERVER</TT
>
mode security is really just a variation on SMB user level security.</P
><P
>Actually, this issue is also closer tied to the debate on whether 
or not Samba must be the domain master browser for its workgroup
when operating as a DC.  While it may technically be possible
to configure a server as such (after all, browsing and domain logons
are two distinctly different functions), it is not a good idea to
so.  You should remember that the DC must register the DOMAIN#1b NetBIOS 
name.  This is the name used by Windows clients to locate the DC.
Windows clients do not distinguish between the DC and the DMB.
For this reason, it is very wise to configure the Samba DC as the DMB.</P
><P
>Now back to the issue of configuring a Samba DC to use a mode other
than "security = user".  If a Samba host is configured to use 
another SMB server or DC in order to validate user connection 
requests, then it is a fact that some other machine on the network 
(the "password server") knows more about user than the Samba host.
99% of the time, this other host is a domain controller.  Now 
in order to operate in domain mode security, the "workgroup" parameter
must be set to the name of the Windows NT domain (which already 
has a domain controller, right?)</P
><P
>Therefore configuring a Samba box as a DC for a domain that 
already by definition has a PDC is asking for trouble.
Therefore, you should always configure the Samba DC to be the DMB
for its domain.</P

The term "Domain Controller" and those related to it refer to one specific
method of authentication that can underly an SMB domain. Domain Controllers
prior to Windows NT Server 3.1 were sold by various companies and based on 
private extensions to the LAN Manager 2.1 protocol. Windows NT introduced
Microsoft-specific ways of distributing the user authentication database.
See DOMAIN.txt for examples of how Samba can participate in or create
SMB domains based on shared authentication database schemes other than the 
Windows NT SAM.</P
><P
>Windows NT Server can be installed as either a plain file and print server
(WORKGROUP workstation or server) or as a server that participates in Domain
Control (DOMAIN member, Primary Domain controller or Backup Domain controller).
The same is true for OS/2 Warp Server, Digital Pathworks and other similar
products, all of which can participate in Domain Control along with Windows NT.</P
><P
>To many people these terms can be confusing, so let's try to clear the air.</P
><P
>Every Windows NT system (workstation or server) has a registry database.
The registry contains entries that describe the initialization information
for all services (the equivalent of Unix Daemons) that run within the Windows
NT environment. The registry also contains entries that tell application
software where to find dynamically loadable libraries that they depend upon.
In fact, the registry contains entries that describes everything that anything
may need to know to interact with the rest of the system.</P
><P
>The registry files can be located on any Windows NT machine by opening a
command prompt and typing:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>C:\WINNT\&#62;</TT
> dir %SystemRoot%\System32\config</P
><P
>The environment variable %SystemRoot% value can be obtained by typing:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>C:\WINNT&#62;</TT
>echo %SystemRoot%</P
><P
>The active parts of the registry that you may want to be familiar with are
the files called: default, system, software, sam and security.</P
><P
>In a domain environment, Microsoft Windows NT domain controllers participate
in replication of the SAM and SECURITY files so that all controllers within
the domain have an exactly identical copy of each.</P
><P
>The Microsoft Windows NT system is structured within a security model that
says that all applications and services must authenticate themselves before
they can obtain permission from the security manager to do what they set out
to do.</P
><P
>The Windows NT User database also resides within the registry. This part of
the registry contains the user's security identifier, home directory, group
memberships, desktop profile, and so on.</P
><P
>Every Windows NT system (workstation as well as server) will have its own
registry. Windows NT Servers that participate in Domain Security control
have a database that they share in common - thus they do NOT own an
independent full registry database of their own, as do Workstations and
plain Servers.</P
><P
>The User database is called the SAM (Security Access Manager) database and
is used for all user authentication as well as for authentication of inter-
process authentication (i.e. to ensure that the service action a user has
requested is permitted within the limits of that user's privileges).</P
><P
>The Samba team have produced a utility that can dump the Windows NT SAM into 
smbpasswd format: see ENCRYPTION.txt for information on smbpasswd and
/pub/samba/pwdump on your nearest Samba mirror for the utility. This 
facility is useful but cannot be easily used to implement SAM replication
to Samba systems.</P
><P
>Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT Workstations and Servers
can participate in a Domain security system that is controlled by Windows NT
servers that have been correctly configured. Almost every domain will have
ONE Primary Domain Controller (PDC). It is desirable that each domain will
have at least one Backup Domain Controller (BDC).</P
><P
>The PDC and BDCs then participate in replication of the SAM database so that
each Domain Controlling participant will have an up to date SAM component
within its registry.</P
