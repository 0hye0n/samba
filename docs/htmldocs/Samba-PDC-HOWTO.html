>Version of Samba prior to release 2.2 had marginal capabilities to
act as a Windows NT 4.0 Primary Domain Controller (PDC).  Please
note that Windows 9x clients are not true members of a domain
for reasons outlined in this article.  Therefore the protocol for
support Windows 9x style domain logons is completely different
from NT4 domain logons and has been officially supported for some 
time.</P
><P
>Beginning with Samba 2.2.0, we are proud to announce official 
support for Windows NT 4.0 style domain logons from Windows NT
4.0 and Windows 2000 (including SP1) clients.  This article 
outlines the steps necessary for configuring Samba as a PDC.
Note that it is necessary to have a working Samba server
prior to implementing the PDC functionality.  If you have not 
followed the steps outlined in <A
HREF="UNIX_INSTALL.html"
TARGET="_top"
>UNIX_INSTALL.html</A
>, please make sure that your server 
is configured correctly before proceeding.  Another good 
resource in the <A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html"

>smb.conf(5) man 
page</A
>.</P

concepts.  They will be mentioned only briefly here.</P

of Samba, Kerberos, and Active Directory.  Samba <I

not</I

There are actually three pieces to this puzzle.</P

understand the parameters necesary in smb.conf.  I will not
attempt to re-explain the parameters here as they are more that
adequately covered in <A
