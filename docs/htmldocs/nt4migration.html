poor planning. The corrollary to this saying is that not all problems can be anticpated
and planned for. Then again, good planning will anticpate most show stopper type situations.</P

environment would do well to develop a detailed migration plan. So here are a few pointers to
help migration get under way.</P

><P
>The key objective for most organisations will be to make the migration from MS Windows NT4 
to Samba-3 domain control as painless as possible. One of the challenges you may experience
in your migration process may well be one of convincing management that the new environment
should remain in place. Many who have introduced open source technologies have experienced
pressure to return to a Microsoft based platform solution at the first sign of trouble. </P
><P
>It is strongly advised that before attempting a migration to a Samba-3 controlled network
that every possible effort be made to gain all-round commitment to the change. Firstly, you
should know precisely <SPAN

Possible motivations to make a change include:</P

>It is vital that oit be well recognised that Samba-3 is NOT MS Windows NT4. Samba-3 offers
an alternative solution that is both different from MS Windows NT4 and that offers some
advantages compared with it. It should also be recognised that Samba-3 lacks many of the
features that Microsoft has promoted as core values in migration from MS Windows NT4 to 
MS Windows 2000 and beyond (with or without Active Directory services).</P

is not lost.

1. You will have an NT4 PDC that has the users, groups, policies and profiles to be migrated

2. Samba-3 set up as a DC with netlogon share, profile share, etc.

3. Process:
	a. Create a BDC account for the samba server using NT Server Manager
		- Samba must NOT be running

	b. rpcclient NT4PDC -U Administrator%passwd
		lsaquery

		Note the SID returned by step b.

	c. net getsid -S NT4PDC -w DOMNAME -U Administrator%passwd

		Note the SID in step c.

	d. net getlocalsid

		Note the SID, now check that all three SIDS reported are the same!

	e. net rpc join -S NT4PDC -w DOMNAME -U Administrator%passwd

	f. net rpc vampire -S NT4PDC -U administrator%passwd

	g. pdbedit -l

		Note - did the users migrate?

	h. initGrps.sh DOMNAME

	i. smbgroupedit -v

		Now check that all groups are recognised

	j. net rpc campire -S NT4PDC -U administrator%passwd

	k. pdbedit -lv

		Note - check that all group membership has been migrated.


Now it is time to migrate all the profiles, then migrate all policy files.

Moe later.</P
