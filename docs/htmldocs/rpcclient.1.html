> The MSRPC over SMB code has 
	been developed from examining  Network traces. No documentation is 
	available from the original creators  (Microsoft) on how MSRPC over 
	SMB works, or how the individual MSRPC services  work. Microsoft's 
	implementation of these services has been demonstrated  (and reported) 
	to be... a bit flakey in places. </P

>The development of Samba's implementation is also a bit rough,

	versions of  <B

CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpcclient</B
> 
	that are incompatible for some commands or  services. Additionally,
