		NT permissions. The UNIX world permissions are mapped into 
		the global NT group <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Everyone</B
>, followed 
		by the list of permissions allowed for UNIX world. The UNIX 
		owner and group permissions are displayed as an NT 
		<B

		overloads the NT <B

>"Take Ownership"</B
> ACL attribute 
		(which has no meaning in UNIX) and reports a component with 
		no permissions as having the NT <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"O"</B

		This was chosen of course to make it look like a zero, meaning 
		zero permissions. More details on the decision behind this will

> 
	button will not return a list of users in Samba (it will give 
	an error message of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"The remote procedure call failed

	manipulate the current user/group/world permissions listed in 
	the dialog box. This actually works quite well as these are the 
	only permissions that UNIX actually has.</P
><P
>If a permission triple (either user, group, or world) 
	is removed from the list of permissions in the NT dialog box, 
	then when the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

	be applied as "no permissions" on the UNIX side. If you then 
	view the permissions again the "no permissions" entry will appear 
	as the NT <B

	allows you to add permissions back to a file or directory once 
	you have removed them from a triple component.</P
