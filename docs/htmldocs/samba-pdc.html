><P
>A machine trust account is a Samba account that is used to
authenticate a client machine (rather than a user) to the Samba
server.  In Windows terminology, this is known as a "Computer
Account."</P
><P
>The password of a machine trust account acts as the shared secret for
secure communication with the Domain Controller.  This is a security
feature to prevent an unauthorized machine with the same NetBIOS name
from joining the domain and gaining access to domain user/group
accounts.  Windows NT, 200x, XP Professional clients use machine trust
accounts, but Windows 9x / Me / XP Home clients do not.  Hence, a
Windows 9x / Me / XP Home  client is never a true member of a domain
because it does not possess a machine trust account, and thus has no
shared secret with the domain controller.</P
><P
>A Windows PDC stores each machine trust account in the Windows
Registry. A Samba-3 PDC also has to stoe machine trust account information
in a suitable back-end data store. With Samba-3 there can be multiple back-ends
for this including:</P

>This occurs when the domain SID stored in the secrets.tdb database
is changed. The most common cause of a change in domain SID is when
the domain name and/or the server name (netbios name) is changed.
The only way to correct the problem is to restore the original domain 
SID or remove the domain client from the domain and rejoin. The domain
SID may be reset using either the smbpasswd or rpcclient utilities.</P

If you are using the <VAR

accounts then this would indicate that it has not worked. Ensure the domain 
admin user system is working.</P
><P
>Alternatively if you are creating account entries manually then they 
have not been created correctly. Make sure that you have the entry 
correct for the machine trust account in smbpasswd file on the Samba PDC. 
If you added the account using an editor rather than using the smbpasswd 
utility, make sure that the account name is the machine NetBIOS name 
with a '$' appended to it ( i.e. computer_name$ ). There must be an entry 
in both /etc/passwd and the smbpasswd file. Some people have reported 
that inconsistent subnet masks between the Samba server and the NT 
client have caused this problem.   Make sure that these are consistent 
for both client and server.</P

>A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same thing in terms of network
browsing.  The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network.  Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server. Samba-3 does this
now in the same way that MS Windows NT/2K.</P
><P
>The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is identical and
is explained in this documentation under the browsing discussions.
It should be noted, that browsing is totally orthogonal to logon support.</P
><P
>Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
section.  Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts, and user
profiles for MS Windows for workgroups and MS Windows 9X/ME clients
which are the focus of this section.</P
><P
>When an SMB client in a domain wishes to logon it broadcast requests for a
logon server.  The first one to reply gets the job, and validates its
password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but very stupid) to create a domain where the user
database is not shared between servers, i.e. they are effectively workgroup
servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain.  This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely
involved with domains.</P
><P
>Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server; make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.</P
><P
>Before launching into the configuration instructions, it is 
worthwhile lookingat how a Windows 9x/ME client performs a logon:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>	The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
	a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS name DOMAIN&#60;1c&#62; at the
	NetBIOS layer.  The client chooses the first response it receives, which
	contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
	\\SERVER.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to that server, logs on (does an SMBsessetupX) and
	then connects to the IPC$ share (using an SMBtconX).
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then does a NetWkstaUserLogon request, which retrieves the name
	of the user's logon script. 
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to the NetLogon share and searches for this 	
	and if it is found and can be read, is retrieved and executed by the client.
	After this, the client disconnects from the NetLogon share.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then sends a NetUserGetInfo request to the server, to retrieve
	the user's home share, which is used to search for profiles. Since the
	response to the NetUserGetInfo request does not contain much more 	
	the user's home share, profiles for Win9X clients MUST reside in the user
	home directory.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to the user's home share and searches for the 
	user's profile. As it turns out, you can specify the user's home share as
	a sharename and path. For example, \\server\fred\.profile.
	If the profiles are found, they are implemented.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then disconnects from the user's home share, and reconnects to
	the NetLogon share and looks for CONFIG.POL, the policies file. If this is
	found, it is read and implemented.

>There are a few comments to make in order to tie up some 
loose ends.  There has been much debate over the issue of whether
or not it is ok to configure Samba as a Domain Controller in security
modes other than <CODE
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>USER</CODE
>.  The only security mode 
which  will not work due to technical reasons is <CODE
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>SHARE</CODE
>
mode security.  <CODE
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>DOMAIN</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>SERVER</CODE
>
mode security is really just a variation on SMB user level security.</P
><P
>Actually, this issue is also closely tied to the debate on whether 
or not Samba must be the domain master browser for its workgroup
when operating as a DC.  While it may technically be possible
to configure a server as such (after all, browsing and domain logons
are two distinctly different functions), it is not a good idea to
so.  You should remember that the DC must register the DOMAIN#1b NetBIOS 
name.  This is the name used by Windows clients to locate the DC.
Windows clients do not distinguish between the DC and the DMB.
For this reason, it is very wise to configure the Samba DC as the DMB.</P
><P
>Now back to the issue of configuring a Samba DC to use a mode other
than "security = user".  If a Samba host is configured to use 
another SMB server or DC in order to validate user connection 
requests, then it is a fact that some other machine on the network 
(the "password server") knows more about user than the Samba host.
99% of the time, this other host is a domain controller.  Now 
in order to operate in domain mode security, the "workgroup" parameter
must be set to the name of the Windows NT domain (which already 
has a domain controller, right?)</P
><P
>Therefore configuring a Samba box as a DC for a domain that 
already by definition has a PDC is asking for trouble.
Therefore, you should always configure the Samba DC to be the DMB
for its domain.</P
