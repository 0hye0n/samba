><P
>The Common Unix Print System (CUPS) has become very popular, but to many it is
a very mystical tool. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding CUPS and how
it works. The result is seen in a large number of posting on the samba mailing lists
expressing frustration when MS Windows printers appear not to work with a CUPS
backr-end.</P
><P
>This is a good time to point out how CUPS can be used and what it does. CUPS is more
than just a print spooling system - it is a complete printer management system that
complies with HTTP and IPP protocols. It can be managed remotely via a web browser
and it can print using http and ipp protocols.</P
><P
>CUPS allows to creation of RAW printers (ie: NO file format translation) as well as
SMART printers (ie: CUPS does file format conversion as required for the printer). In
many ways this gives CUPS similar capabilities to the MS Windows print monitoring
system. Of course, if you are a CUPS advocate, you would agrue that CUPS is better!
In any case, let us now move on to explore how one may configure CUPS for interfacing
with MS Windows print clients via Samba.</P

which has convinced many people upon first trial already. However, it has quite a few
new features, which make it different from other, more traditional printing systems.</P

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

anymore, the <TT

(example: <B

printed "raw".  However, if you have loaded the driver for the Windows client from
the CUPS server, using the "cupsaddsmb" utility, and if this driver is one using
a "Foomatic" PPD, the PJL header in question is already added on the Windows client,
at the time when the driver initially generated the PostScript data and CUPS in true
"-oraw" manner doesn't remove this PJL header and passes the file "as is" to its
printer communication backend.</P

>"cupsomatic"/Foomatic are *not* native CUPS drivers and they don't ship with CUPS.
They are a Third Party add-on, developed at Linuxprinting.org.  As such, they are
a brilliant hack to make all models (driven by Ghostscript drivers/filters in
traditional spoolers) also work via CUPS, with the same (good or bad!) quality
as in these other spoolers. "cupsomatic" is only a vehicle to execute a ghostscript
commandline at that stage in the CUPS filtering chain, where "normally" the native
CUPS "pstoraster" filter would kick in.  cupsomatic by-passes pstoraster, "kidnaps"
the printfile from CUPS away and re-directs it to go through Ghostscipt. CUPS accepts this,
because the associated CUPS-O-Matic-/Foomatic-PPD specifies:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   *cupsFilter:  "application/vnd.cups-postscript 0 cupsomatic"</PRE
><P
>This line persuades CUPS to hand the file to cupsomatic, once it has successfully
converted it to the MIME type "application/vnd.cups-postscript". This conversion will not
happen for Jobs arriving from Windows which are auto-typed "application/octet-stream",
with the according changes in "/etc/cups/mime.types" in place.</P
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></DIV
><P
>CUPS is widely configurable and flexible, even regarding its filtering mechanism.
Another workaround in some situations would be to have
in "/etc/cups/mime.types" entries as follows:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   application/postscript           application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
   application/vnd.cups-postscript  application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -</PRE
><P
>This would prevent all Postscript files from being filtered (rather, they will go
thru the virtual "nullfilter" denoted with "-"). This could only be useful for
PS printers. If you want to print PS code on non-PS printers an entry as follows
could be useful:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   */*           application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -</PRE
><P
>and would effectively send *all* files to the backend without further processing.</P
><P
>Lastly, you could have the following entry:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   application/vnd.cups-postscript  application/vnd.cups-raw  0  my_PJL_stripping_filter</PRE
><P
>You will need to write a "my_PJL_stripping_filter" (could be a shellscript) that
parses the PostScript and removes the unwanted PJL. This would need to conform to
CUPS filter design (mainly, receive and pass the parameters printername, job-id,
username, jobtitle, copies, print options and possibly the filename). It would
be installed as world executable into "/usr/lib/cups/filters/" and will be called
by CUPS if it encounters a MIME type "application/vnd.cups-postscript".</P
><P
>CUPS can handle "-o job-hold-until=indefinite". This keeps the job in the queue
"on hold". It will only be printed upon manual release by the printer operator.
This is a requirement in many "central reproduction departments", where a few
operators manage the jobs of hundreds of users on some big machine, where no
user is allowed to have direct access. (The operators often need to load the
proper paper type before running the 10.000 page job requested by marketing
for the mailing, etc.).</P

>14.4. CUPS as a network PostScript RIP -- CUPS drivers working on server, Adobe
PostScript driver with CUPS-PPDs downloaded to clients</A
></H1
><P
>CUPS is perfectly able to use PPD files (PostScript
Printer Descriptions). PPDs can control all print device options. They
are usually provided by the manufacturer -- if you own a PostSript printer,
that is. PPD files are always a component of PostScript printer drivers on MS
Windows or Apple Mac OS systems. They are ASCII files containing
user-selectable print options, mapped to appropriate PostScript, PCL or PJL
commands for the target printer. Printer driver GUI dialogs translate these
options "on-the-fly" into buttons and drop-down lists for the user to
select.</P
><P
>CUPS can load, without any conversions, the PPD file from
any Windows (NT is recommended) PostScript driver and handle the options.
There is a web browser interface to the print options (select
http://localhost:631/printers/ and click on one "Configure Printer" button
to see it), a commandline interface (see <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>man lpoptions</B
> or
try if you have <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lphelp</B
> on your system) plus some different GUI frontends on Linux
UNIX, which can present PPD options to the users. PPD options are normally
meant to become evaluated by the PostScript RIP on the real PostScript
printer.</P
><P
>CUPS doesn't stop at "real" PostScript printers in its
usage of PPDs. The CUPS developers have extended the PPD concept, to also
describe available device and driver options for non-PostScript printers
through  CUPS-PPDs.</P
><P
>This is logical, as CUPS includes a fully featured
PostScript interpreter (RIP). This RIP is based on Ghostscript. It can
process all received PostScript (and additionally many other file formats)
from clients. All CUPS-PPDs geared to non-PostScript printers contain an
additional line, starting with the keyword <VAR
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>*cupsFilter</VAR
>.
This line
tells the CUPS print system which printer-specific filter to use for the
interpretation of the accompanying PostScript. Thus CUPS lets all its
printers appear as PostScript devices to its clients, because it can act as a
PostScript RIP for those printers, processing the received PostScript code
into a proper raster print format.</P
><P
>CUPS-PPDs can also be used on Windows-Clients, on top of a
PostScript driver (recommended is the Adobe one).</P
><P
>This feature enables CUPS to do a few tricks no other
spooler can do:</P

></H1
><P
>This setup may be of special interest to people
experiencing major problems in WTS environments. WTS need often a multitude
of non-PostScript drivers installed to run their clients' variety of
different printer models. This often imposes the price of much increased
instability. In many cases, in an attempt to overcome this problem, site
administrators have resorted to restrict the allowed drivers installed on
their WTS to one generic PCL- and one PostScript driver. This however
restricts the clients in the amount of printer options available for them --
often they can't get out more then simplex prints from one standard paper
tray, while their devices could do much better, if driven by a different
driver!</P
><P
>Using an Adobe PostScript driver, enabled with a CUPS-PPD,
seems to be a very elegant way to overcome all these shortcomings. The
PostScript driver is not known to cause major stability problems on WTS (even
if used with many different PPDs). The clients will be able to (again) chose
paper trays, duplex printing and other settings. However, there is a certain
price for this too: a  CUPS server acting as a PostScript RIP for its clients
requires more CPU and RAM than just to act as  a "raw spooling" device. Plus,
this setup is not yet widely tested, although the first feedbacks look very
promising...</P

>the cupsomatic trick from Linuxprinting.org is
working different from the other drivers. While the other drivers take the
generic CUPS raster (produced by CUPS' own pstoraster PostScript RIP) as
their input, cupsomatic "kidnaps" the PostScript inside CUPS, before
RIP-ping, deviates it to an external Ghostscript installation (which now
becomes the RIP) and gives it back to a CUPS backend once Ghostscript is
finished. -- CUPS versions from 1.1.15 and later will provide their pstoraster
PostScript RIP function again inside a system-wide Ghostscript
installation rather than in "their own" pstoraster filter. (This
CUPS-enabling Ghostscript version may be installed either as a
patch to GNU or AFPL Ghostscript, or as a complete ESP Ghostscript package).
However, this will not change the cupsomatic approach of guiding the printjob
along a different path through the filtering system than the standard CUPS
way...</P

that driver within the various available spoolers. You can generate a PPD for
CUPS. The PPD contains all the info about how to use your model and the driver;
this is, once installed, working transparently for the user -- you'll only
need to choose resolution, paper size etc. from the web-based menu or from
the print dialog GUI or from the commandline...</P
><P
>On the driver's page, choose to use the "PPD-O-Matic" online PPD generator
program. Select your model and click "Generate PPD file". When you safe the
appearing ASCII text file, don't use "cut'n'past" (as it could possiblly corrupt
line endings and tabs), but use "Save as..." in your browser's menu. Save it
at "/some/path/on/your/filesystem/somewhere/my-name-for-my-printer.ppd"</P

>Note, that for all the "Foomatic-PPDs" from Linuxprinting.org, you also need
a special "CUPS filter" named "cupsomatic". Get the latest version of
"cupsomatic" from:</P
><P

HREF="http://www.linuxprinting.org/cupsomatic"

and be made world executable. This filter is needed to read and act upon the
specially encoded Foomatic comments, embedded in the printfile, which in turn
are used to construct (transparently for you, the user) the complicated
ghostscript command line needed for your printer/driver combo.</P
><P
>You can have a look at all the options for the Ghostscript commandline supported
by your printer and the ljet4 driver by going to the section "Execution details",
selecting your model (Laserjet 4 Plus) and clicking on "Show execution details".
This will bring up this web page:</P

Quotas can be based on sizes of jobs or on the number of pages or both,

data (whichever comes first) within the last 604.800 seconds ( = 1 week).</P
><P
>For CUPS to count correctly, the printfile needs to pass the CUPS "pstops" filter,
otherwise it uses a "dummy" count of "1". Some printfiles don't pass it
(eg: image files) but then those are mostly 1 page jobs anyway. This also means,
proprietary drivers for the target printer running on the client computers and
CUPS/Samba then spooling these files as "raw" (i.e. leaving them untouched, not
filtering them), will be counted as "1-pagers" too!</P
><P
>You need to send PostScript from the clients (i.e. run a PostScript driver there)
for having the chance to get accounting done. If the printer is a non-PostScript model,
you need to let CUPS do the job to convert the file to a print-ready format for the
target printer. This will be working for currently ~1.000 different printer models, see</P

Driver on the Windows clients. The output of this driver was not always
passed thru the "pstops" filter on the CUPS/Samba side, and therefor was
not counted correctly (the reason is that it often --- depending on the
"PPD" being used --- did write a "PJL"-header in front of the real
PostScript which made CUPS to skip the pstops and go directy to
the "pstoraster" stage).</P

>This new CUPS PostScript driver is currently binary-only, but free
no source code is provided (yet). The reason is this: it has
been developed with the help of the Microsoft Driver Developer Kit (DDK)
and compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 6. It is not clear to the driver
developers if they are allowed to distribute the whole of the source code
as Free Software. However, they will likely release the "diff" in source
code under the GPL, so anybody with a license of Visual Studio and a DDK
will be able to compile for him/herself.</P

and contains a subdir tree with WIN40 and W32X86 branches), by running
"cupsaddsmb" (see also "man cupsaddsmb" for CUPS 1.1.16). [Don't forget to
put root into the smbpasswd file by running "smbpasswd" should you run
this whole procedure for the first time.] Once the driver files are in the

you probably will need to set up a second server (which can do automatic load balancing

PostScript jobs, "interpreting" them for non-PostScript printers, amounts to the work
of a "RIP" (Raster Image Processor) done in software. This requires more CPU and RAM
than for the mere "raw spooling" task your current setup is solving. It all depends
on the avarage and peak printing load the server should be able to handle.</P
