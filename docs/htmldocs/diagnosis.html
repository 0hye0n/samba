Samba server. It also tells you what the likely cause of the problem
is if it fails any one of these steps. If it passes all these tests
then it is probably working fine.</P

carefully choose them so later tests only use capabilities verified in
the earlier tests.</P

and you have not followed this test procedure then you should not be surprised
your email is ignored.</P

the unix box. If you don't get a valid response then your TCP/IP
software is not correctly installed. </P

run ping.</P
><P
>If you get a message saying "host not found" or similar then your DNS
software or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> file is not correctly setup.
It is possible to
run samba without DNS entries for the server and client, but I assume
you do have correct entries for the remainder of these tests. </P
><P
>Another reason why ping might fail is if your host is running firewall 
software. You will need to relax the rules to let in the workstation
in question, perhaps by allowing access from another subnet (on Linux
this is done via the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>ipfwadm</SPAN
> program.)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Run the command <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>smbclient -L BIGSERVER</KBD
> on the unix box. You
should get a list of available shares back. </P
><P
>If you get a error message containing the string "Bad password" then
you probably have either an incorrect <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hosts allow</B
>, 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hosts deny</B
> or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>valid users</B
> line in your 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
>, or your guest account is not
valid. Check what your guest account is using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>testparm</SPAN
> and
temporarily remove any <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hosts allow</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hosts deny</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>valid users</B
> or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>invalid users</B
> lines.</P
><P
>If you get a "connection refused" response then the smbd server may
not be running. If you installed it in inetd.conf then you probably edited
that file incorrectly. If you installed it as a daemon then check that
it is running, and check that the netbios-ssn port is in a LISTEN
state using <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>netstat -a</KBD
>.</P
><P
>If you get a "session request failed" then the server refused the
connection. If it says "Your server software is being unfriendly" then
its probably because you have invalid command line parameters to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>smbd</SPAN
>,
or a similar fatal problem with the initial startup of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>smbd</SPAN
>. Also
check your config file (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
>) for syntax errors with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>testparm</SPAN
>
and that the various directories where samba keeps its log and lock
files exist.</P
><P
>There are a number of reasons for which smbd may refuse or decline
a session request. The most common of these involve one or more of
the following <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
> file entries:</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>	hosts deny = ALL
	hosts allow = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy
	bind interfaces only = Yes</PRE
></P
><P
>In the above, no allowance has been made for any session requests that
will automatically translate to the loopback adaptor address 127.0.0.1.
To solve this problem change these lines to:</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>	hosts deny = ALL
	hosts allow = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy 127.</PRE
></P
><P
>Do NOT use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bind interfaces only</B
> parameter where you 
may wish to
use the samba password change facility, or where <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>smbclient</SPAN
> may need to
access local service for name resolution or for local resource
connections. (Note: the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bind interfaces only</B
> parameter deficiency
where it will not allow connections to the loopback address will be
fixed soon).</P
><P
>Another common cause of these two errors is having something already running 
on port 139, such as Samba (ie: smbd is running from <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>inetd</SPAN
> already) or
something like Digital's Pathworks. Check your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>inetd.conf</TT
> file before trying
to start <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>smbd</SPAN
> as a daemon, it can avoid a lot of frustration!</P
><P
>And yet another possible cause for failure of this test is when the subnet mask
and / or broadcast address settings are incorrect. Please check that the
network interface IP Address / Broadcast Address / Subnet Mask settings are
correct and that Samba has correctly noted these in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>log.nmb</TT
> file.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Run the command <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>nmblookup -B BIGSERVER __SAMBA__</KBD
>. You should get the
IP address of your Samba server back.</P
><P
>If you don't then nmbd is incorrectly installed. Check your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>inetd.conf</TT
>
if you run it from there, or that the daemon is running and listening
to udp port 137.</P
><P
>One common problem is that many inetd implementations can't take many
parameters on the command line. If this is the case then create a
one-line script that contains the right parameters and run that from
inetd.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>run the command <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>nmblookup -B ACLIENT '*'</KBD
></P
><P
>You should get the PCs IP address back. If you don't then the client
software on the PC isn't installed correctly, or isn't started, or you
got the name of the PC wrong. </P
><P
>If ACLIENT doesn't resolve via DNS then use the IP address of the
client in the above test.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Run the command <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>nmblookup -d 2 '*'</KBD
></P
><P
>This time we are trying the same as the previous test but are trying
it via a broadcast to the default broadcast address. A number of
Netbios/TCPIP hosts on the network should respond, although Samba may
not catch all of the responses in the short time it listens. You
should see "got a positive name query response" messages from several
hosts.</P
><P
>If this doesn't give a similar result to the previous test then
nmblookup isn't correctly getting your broadcast address through its
automatic mechanism. In this case you should experiment use the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>interfaces</B
> option in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
> to manually configure your IP
address, broadcast and netmask. </P
><P
>If your PC and server aren't on the same subnet then you will need to
use the <VAR
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>-B</VAR
> option to set the broadcast address to the that of the PCs
subnet.</P
><P
>This test will probably fail if your subnet mask and broadcast address are
not correct. (Refer to TEST 3 notes above).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Run the command <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>smbclient //BIGSERVER/TMP</KBD
>. You should 
then be prompted for a password. You should use the password of the account
you are logged into the unix box with. If you want to test with
another account then add the <VAR
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>-U <VAR
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
>accountname</VAR
></VAR
> option to the end of
the command line.  eg:
