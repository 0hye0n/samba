>This document will show you one way of making Version 2.2.0  
of Samba perform some of the tasks of a 
NT Primary Domain Controller. The facilities described are built into Samba as a result of 
development work done over a number of years by a large number of people. These facilities 
are only just beginning to be officially supported and although they do appear to work reliably, 
if you use them then you take the risks upon your self.  This document does not cover the
developmental versions of Samba, particularly

	In our simple case every domain user should have an account on the PDC. The 
	account may have a null shell if they are not allowed to log on to the unix 
	prompt. Again they need an entry in both the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> and
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd</TT
>. Again a password is 
	not necessary in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> but the location 
	of the home directory is honoured. 
	To make an entry for a user called Joe Blow you would typically do the following :</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"

><P

	hovering over your shoulder and will, when asked, type in a password of 
	his choice. There are a number of scripts and systems to ease the migration of users
	from somewhere to samba. Better start looking !</P

><P
>It might help you understand the limitations of the PDC in Samba if you
	read something of its history. Well, the history as I understand it anyway.</P
><P
>For many years the Samba team have been developing Samba, some time ago 
	a number of people, possibly lead by Luke Leighton started contributing NT 
	PDC stuff. This was added to the 'head' stream (that would eventually
	become the next version) and later to a seperate stream (NTDom). They did so 
	much that eventually this development stream was so mutated that it could not 
	be merged back into the main stream and was abandoned towards the end of 1999. 
	And that was very sad because many users, myself include had become heavily
	dependant on the NTController facilities it offered. Oh well...</P
><P
>The NTDom team continued on with their new found knowledge however and 
	built the TNG stream. Intended to be carefully controlled so that it can be 
	merged back into the main stream and benefiting from what they learnt, it is 
	a very different product to the origional NTDom product. However, for a 
    number of reasons, the merge did not take place and now TNG is being developed 
    at <A
HREF="http://www.samba-tng.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.samba-tng.org</A
>.</P
><P
>Now, the NTDom things that the main strean 2.0.x version does is based more 
	on the old (initial version) abandoned code than on the TNG ideas. It appears 
	that version 2.2.0 will also include an improved version of the 2.0.7 domain 
	controller charactistics, not the TNG ways. The developers have indicated 
	that 2.2.0 will be further developed incrementally and the ideas from TNG 
	incorporated into it.</P
><P
>One more little wriggle is worth mentioning. At one stage the NTDom 
	stream was called Samba 2.1.0-prealpha and similar names. This is most 
	unfortunate because at least one book published advises people who want to 
	use NTDom Samba to get version 2.1.0 or later. As main stream Samba will soon 
	be called 2.2.0  and NOT officially supporting NTDom Controlling functions, 
	the potential for confusion is certainly there.</P
