		this have mostly been fixed. It is now less likely that you 
		will want to use less than LANMAN1. The only remaining advantage 
		of COREPLUS is that for some obscure reason WfWg preserves 
		the case of passwords in this protocol, whereas under LANMAN1, 
		LANMAN2 or NT1 it uppercases all passwords before sending them,
		forcing you to use the "password level=" option in some cases.</P

NAME="AEN200">Locking</H3
><P
>One area which sometimes causes trouble is locking.</P
><P
>There are two types of locking which need to be 
		performed by a SMB server. The first is "record locking" 
		which allows a client to lock a range of bytes in a open file. 
		The second is the "deny modes" that are specified when a file 
		is open.</P
><P
>Record locking semantics under Unix is very
		different from record locking under Windows. Versions
		of Samba before 2.2 have tried to use the native
		fcntl() unix system call to implement proper record
		locking between different Samba clients. This can not
		be fully correct due to several reasons. The simplest
		is the fact that a Windows client is allowed to lock a
		byte range up to 2^32 or 2^64, depending on the client
		OS. The unix locking only supports byte ranges up to
		2^31. So it is not possible to correctly satisfy a
		lock request above 2^31. There are many more
		differences, too many to be listed here.</P
><P
>Samba 2.2 and above implements record locking
		completely independent of the underlying unix
		system. If a byte range lock that the client requests
		happens to fall into the range 0-2^31, Samba hands
		this request down to the Unix system. All other locks
		can not be seen by unix anyway.</P
><P
>Strictly a SMB server should check for locks before 
		every read and write call on a file. Unfortunately with the 
		way fcntl() works this can be slow and may overstress the 
		rpc.lockd. It is also almost always unnecessary as clients 
		are supposed to independently make locking calls before reads 
		and writes anyway if locking is important to them. By default 
		Samba only makes locking calls when explicitly asked
		to by a client, but if you set "strict locking = yes" then it will
		make lock checking calls on every read and write. </P
><P
>You can also disable by range locking completely 
		using "locking = no". This is useful for those shares that 
		don't support locking or don't need it (such as cdroms). In 
		this case Samba fakes the return codes of locking calls to 
		tell clients that everything is OK.</P
><P
>The second class of locking is the "deny modes". These 
		are set by an application when it opens a file to determine 
		what types of access should be allowed simultaneously with 
		its open. A client may ask for DENY_NONE, DENY_READ, DENY_WRITE 
		or DENY_ALL. There are also special compatibility modes called 
		DENY_FCB and  DENY_DOS.</P

temporarily remove any "hosts allow", "hosts deny", "valid users" or

>If you get a "connection refused" response then the smbd server may
not be running. If you installed it in inetd.conf then you probably edited
that file incorrectly. If you installed it as a daemon then check that
it is running, and check that the netbios-ssn port is in a LISTEN
state using "netstat -a".</P
><P
>If you get a "session request failed" then the server refused the
connection. If it says "Your server software is being unfriendly" then
its probably because you have invalid command line parameters to smbd,
or a similar fatal problem with the initial startup of smbd. Also
check your config file (smb.conf) for syntax errors with "testparm"
and that the various directories where samba keeps its log and lock
files exist.</P

a session request. The most common of these involve one or more of
the following smb.conf file entries:</P

use the samba password change facility, or where smbclient may need to
access local service for name resolution or for local resource
connections. (Note: the "bind interfaces only" parameter deficiency
where it will not allow connections to the loopback address will be
fixed soon).</P
><P
>Another common cause of these two errors is having something already running 
on port 139, such as Samba (ie: smbd is running from inetd already) or
something like Digital's Pathworks. Check your inetd.conf file before trying
to start smbd as a daemon, it can avoid a lot of frustration!</P
><P
>And yet another possible cause for failure of TEST 3 is when the subnet mask

>The purpose of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> is to provide a 
name resolution mechanism so that uses do not need to remember 
IP addresses.</P
><P
>Network packets that are sent over the physical network transport 
layer communicate not via IP addresses but rather using the Media 
Access Control address, or MAC address. IP Addresses are currently 
32 bits in length and are typically presented as four (4) decimal 
numbers that are separated by a dot (or period). eg: 168.192.1.1</P
><P
>MAC Addresses use 48 bits (or 6 bytes) and are typically represented 
as two digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons. eg: 
40:8e:0a:12:34:56</P
><P
>Every network interfrace must have an MAC address. Associated with 
a MAC address there may be one or more IP addresses. There is NO 
relationship between an IP address and a MAC address, all such assignments 
are arbitary or discretionary in nature. At the most basic level all 
network communications takes place using MAC addressing. Since MAC 
addresses must be globally unique, and generally remains fixed for 
any particular interface, the assignment of an IP address makes sense 
from a network management perspective. More than one IP address can 
be assigned per MAC address. One address must be the primary IP address, 
this is the address that will be returned in the ARP reply.</P
><P
>When a user or a process wants to communicate with another machine 
the protocol implementation ensures that the "machine name" or "host 
name" is resolved to an IP address in a manner that is controlled 
by the TCP/IP configuration control files. The file 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> is one such file.</P
><P
>When the IP address of the destination interface has been 
determined a protocol called ARP/RARP is used to identify 
the MAC address of the target interface. ARP stands for Address 
Resolution Protocol, and is a broadcast oriented method that 
uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to send a request to all 
interfaces on the local network segment using the all 1's MAC 
address. Network interfaces are programmed to respond to two 
MAC addresses only; their own unique address and the address 
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. The reply packet from an ARP request will 
contain the MAC address and the primary IP address for each 
interface.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> file is foundational to all 
Unix/Linux TCP/IP installations and as a minumum will contain 
the localhost and local network interface IP addresses and the 
primary names by which they are known within the local machine. 
This file helps to prime the pump so that a basic level of name 
resolution can exist before any other method of name resolution 
becomes available.</P

>Samba version 2.2.0 will add Linux support for extensions to 
the name service switch infrastructure so that linux clients will 
be able to obtain resolution of MS Windows NetBIOS names to IP 
Addresses. To gain this functionality Samba needs to be compiled 
with appropriate arguments to the make command (ie: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make 
nsswitch/libnss_wins.so</B
>). The resulting library should 
then be installed in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib</TT
> directory and 
the "wins" parameter needs to be added to the "hosts:" line in 
the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT
> file. At this point it 
will be possible to ping any MS Windows machine by it's NetBIOS 
machine name, so long as that machine is within the workgroup to 
which both the samba machine and the MS Windows machine belong.</P

NAME="AEN447">Name resolution as used within MS Windows networking</H2
><P
>MS Windows networking is predicated about the name each machine 
is given. This name is known variously (and inconsistently) as 
the "computer name", "machine name", "networking name", "netbios name", 
"SMB name". All terms mean the same thing with the exception of 
"netbios name" which can apply also to the name of the workgroup or the 
domain name. The terms "workgroup" and "domain" are really just a 
simply name with which the machine is associated. All NetBIOS names 
are exactly 16 characters in length. The 16th character is reserved. 
It is used to store a one byte value that indicates service level 
information for the NetBIOS name that is registered. A NetBIOS machine 
name is therefore registered for each service type that is provided by 
the client/server.</P
><P
>The following are typical NetBIOS name/service type registrations:</P
><P
><TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>	Unique NetBIOS Names:
		MACHINENAME&#60;00&#62;	= Server Service is running on MACHINENAME
		MACHINENAME&#60;03&#62; = Generic Machine Name (NetBIOS name)
		MACHINENAME&#60;20&#62; = LanMan Server service is running on MACHINENAME
		WORKGROUP&#60;1b&#62; = Domain Master Browser

	Group Names:
		WORKGROUP&#60;03&#62; = Generic Name registered by all members of WORKGROUP
		WORKGROUP&#60;1c&#62; = Domain Controllers / Netlogon Servers
		WORKGROUP&#60;1d&#62; = Local Master Browsers
		WORKGROUP&#60;1e&#62; = Internet Name Resolvers</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>It should be noted that all NetBIOS machines register their own 
names as per the above. This is in vast contrast to TCP/IP 
installations where traditionally the system administrator will 
determine in the /etc/hosts or in the DNS database what names 
are associated with each IP address.</P
><P
>One further point of clarification should be noted, the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> 
file and the DNS records do not provide the NetBIOS name type information 
that MS Windows clients depend on to locate the type of service that may 
be needed. An example of this is what happens when an MS Windows client 
wants to locate a domain logon server. It find this service and the IP 
address of a server that provides it by performing a lookup (via a 
NetBIOS broadcast) for enumeration of all machines that have 
registered the name type *&#60;1c&#62;. A logon request is then sent to each 
IP address that is returned in the enumerated list of IP addresses. Which 
ever machine first replies then ends up providing the logon services.</P
><P
>The name "workgroup" or "domain" really can be confusing since these 
have the added significance of indicating what is the security 
architecture of the MS Windows network. The term "workgroup" indicates 
that the primary nature of the network environment is that of a 
peer-to-peer design. In a WORKGROUP all machines are responsible for 
their own security, and generally such security is limited to use of 
just a password (known as SHARE MODE security). In most situations 
with peer-to-peer networking the users who control their own machines 
will simply opt to have no security at all. It is possible to have 
USER MODE security in a WORKGROUP environment, thus requiring use 
of a user name and a matching password.</P
><P
>MS Windows networking is thus predetermined to use machine names 
for all local and remote machine message passing. The protocol used is 
called Server Message Block (SMB) and this is implemented using

Exchange) protocol as used by Novell NetWare, and it can be run 
over TCP/IP protocols - in which case the resulting protocol is called 
NBT or NetBT, the NetBIOS over TCP/IP.</P

	#
	# This is a sample LMHOSTS file used by the Microsoft Wins Client (NetBIOS
	# over TCP/IP) stack for Windows98
	#
	# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to NT computernames
	# (NetBIOS) names.  Each entry should be kept on an individual line.
	# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the
	# corresponding computername. The address and the comptername
	# should be separated by at least one space or tab. The "#" character
	# is generally used to denote the start of a comment (see the exceptions
	# below).
	#
	# This file is compatible with Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x TCP/IP lmhosts
	# files and offers the following extensions:
	#
	#      #PRE
	#      #DOM:&#60;domain&#62;
	#      #INCLUDE &#60;filename&#62;
	#      #BEGIN_ALTERNATE
	#      #END_ALTERNATE
	#      \0xnn (non-printing character support)
	#
	# Following any entry in the file with the characters "#PRE" will cause
	# the entry to be preloaded into the name cache. By default, entries are
	# not preloaded, but are parsed only after dynamic name resolution fails.
	#
	# Following an entry with the "#DOM:&#60;domain&#62;" tag will associate the
	# entry with the domain specified by &#60;domain&#62;. This affects how the
	# browser and logon services behave in TCP/IP environments. To preload
	# the host name associated with #DOM entry, it is necessary to also add a
	# #PRE to the line. The &#60;domain&#62; is always preloaded although it will not
	# be shown when the name cache is viewed.
	#
	# Specifying "#INCLUDE &#60;filename&#62;" will force the RFC NetBIOS (NBT)
	# software to seek the specified &#60;filename&#62; and parse it as if it were
	# local. &#60;filename&#62; is generally a UNC-based name, allowing a
	# centralized lmhosts file to be maintained on a server.
	# It is ALWAYS necessary to provide a mapping for the IP address of the
	# server prior to the #INCLUDE. This mapping must use the #PRE directive.
	# In addtion the share "public" in the example below must be in the
	# LanManServer list of "NullSessionShares" in order for client machines to
	# be able to read the lmhosts file successfully. This key is under
	# \machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\lanmanserver\parameters\nullsessionshares
	# in the registry. Simply add "public" to the list found there.
	#
	# The #BEGIN_ and #END_ALTERNATE keywords allow multiple #INCLUDE
	# statements to be grouped together. Any single successful include
	# will cause the group to succeed.
	#
	# Finally, non-printing characters can be embedded in mappings by
	# first surrounding the NetBIOS name in quotations, then using the
	# \0xnn notation to specify a hex value for a non-printing character.
	#
	# The following example illustrates all of these extensions:
	#
	# 102.54.94.97     rhino         #PRE #DOM:networking  #net group's DC
	# 102.54.94.102    "appname  \0x14"                    #special app server
	# 102.54.94.123    popular            #PRE             #source server
	# 102.54.94.117    localsrv           #PRE             #needed for the include
	#
	# #BEGIN_ALTERNATE
	# #INCLUDE \\localsrv\public\lmhosts
	# #INCLUDE \\rhino\public\lmhosts
	# #END_ALTERNATE
	#
	# In the above example, the "appname" server contains a special
	# character in its name, the "popular" and "localsrv" server names are
	# preloaded, and the "rhino" server name is specified so it can be used
	# to later #INCLUDE a centrally maintained lmhosts file if the "localsrv"
	# system is unavailable.
	#
	# Note that the whole file is parsed including comments on each lookup,
	# so keeping the number of comments to a minimum will improve performance.
	# Therefore it is not advisable to simply add lmhosts file entries onto the
	# end of this file.</PRE

><P
>As stated above, MS Windows machines register their NetBIOS names 
(i.e.: the machine name for each service type in operation) on start 
up. Also, as stated above, the exact method by which this name registration 
takes place is determined by whether or not the MS Windows client/server 
has been given a WINS server address, whether or not LMHOSTS lookup 
is enabled, or if DNS for NetBIOS name resolution is enabled, etc.</P
><P
>In the case where there is no WINS server all name registrations as 
well as name lookups are done by UDP broadcast. This isolates name 
resolution to the local subnet, unless LMHOSTS is used to list all 
names and IP addresses. In such situations Samba provides a means by 
which the samba server name may be forcibly injected into the browse 
list of a remote MS Windows network (using the "remote announce" parameter).</P
><P
>Where a WINS server is used, the MS Windows client will use UDP 
unicast to register with the WINS server. Such packets can be routed 
and thus WINS allows name resolution to function across routed networks.</P
><P
>During the startup process an election will take place to create a 
local master browser if one does not already exist. On each NetBIOS network 
one machine will be elected to function as the domain master browser. This 
domain browsing has nothing to do with MS security domain control. 
Instead, the domain master browser serves the role of contacting each local 
master browser (found by asking WINS or from LMHOSTS) and exchanging browse 
list contents. This way every master browser will eventually obtain a complete 
list of all machines that are on the network. Every 11-15 minutes an election 
is held to determine which machine will be the master browser. By the nature of 
the election criteria used, the machine with the highest uptime, or the 
most senior protocol version, or other criteria, will win the election 
as domain master browser.</P
><P
>Clients wishing to browse the network make use of this list, but also depend 
on the availability of correct name resolution to the respective IP 
address/addresses. </P
><P
>Any configuration that breaks name resolution and/or browsing intrinsics 
will annoy users because they will have to put up with protracted 
inability to use the network services.</P
><P
>Samba supports a feature that allows forced synchonisation 
of browse lists across routed networks using the "remote 
browse sync" parameter in the smb.conf file. This causes Samba 
to contact the local master browser on a remote network and 
to request browse list synchronisation. This effectively bridges 
two networks that are separated by routers. The two remote 
networks may use either broadcast based name resolution or WINS 
based name resolution, but it should be noted that the "remote 
browse sync" parameter provides browse list synchronisation - and 
that is distinct from name to address resolution, in other 
words, for cross subnet browsing to function correctly it is 
essential that a name to address resolution mechanism be provided. 
This mechanism could be via DNS, <TT

and so on.</P

these versions no longer support plain text passwords by default.</P
><P
>MS Windows clients have a habit of dropping network mappings that 
have been idle for 10 minutes or longer. When the user attempts to 
use the mapped drive connection that has been dropped, the client
re-establishes the connection using 
a cached copy of the password.</P
><P
>When Microsoft changed the default password mode, they dropped support for 
caching of the plain text password. This means that when the registry 
parameter is changed to re-enable use of plain text passwords it appears to 
work, but when a dropped mapping attempts to revalidate it will fail if 
the remote authentication server does not support encrypted passwords. 
This means that it is definitely not a good idea to re-enable plain text 
password support in such clients.</P

><P
>There has been some initial confusion about what all this means
and whether or not it is a requirement for printer drivers to be 
installed on a Samba host in order to support printing from Windows 
clients.  A bug existed in Samba 2.2.0 which made Windows NT/2000 clients 
require that the Samba server possess a valid driver for the printer.  
This is fixed in Samba 2.2.1 and once again, Windows NT/2000 clients
can use the local APW for installing drivers to be used with a Samba 
served printer.  This is the same behavior exhibited by Windows 9x clients.
As a side note, Samba does not use these drivers in any way to process 
spooled files.  They are utilized entirely by the clients.</P

not use the SMB printer share, but rather can print directly 
to any printer on another Windows NT host using MS-RPC.  This
of course assumes that the printing client has the necessary
privileges on the remote host serving the printer.  The default
permissions assigned by Windows NT to a printer gives the "Print"
permissions to the "Everyone" well-known group.</P

you use is up to you.</P

>Samba should set reasonable defaults for these depending on your
system type, but it isn't clairvoyant. It is not uncommon that you
have to tweak these for local conditions.  The commands should
always have fully specified pathnames,  as the smdb may not have
the correct PATH values.</P
><P
>When you send a job to Samba to be printed,  it will make a temporary
copy of it in the directory specified in the [printers] section.
and it should be periodically cleaned out.  The lpr -r option
requests that the temporary copy be removed after printing; If
printing fails then you might find leftover files in this directory,
and it should be periodically cleaned out.  Samba used the lpq
command to determine the "job number" assigned to your print job
by the spooler.</P
><P
>The %&#62;letter&#60; are "macros" that get dynamically replaced with appropriate
values when they are used. The %s gets replaced with the name of the spool
file that Samba creates and the %p gets replaced with the name of the
printer. The %j gets replaced with the "job number" which comes from
the lpq output.</P

><P
>Of the above, "security = server" means that Samba reports to clients that
it is running in "user mode" but actually passes off all authentication
requests to another "user mode" server. This requires an additional
parameter "password server =" that points to the real authentication server.
That real authentication server can be another Samba server or can be a
Windows NT server, the later natively capable of encrypted password support.</P

NAME="AEN1239">More complete description of security levels</H2
><P
>A SMB server tells the client at startup what "security level" it is
running. There are two options "share level" and "user level". Which
of these two the client receives affects the way the client then tries
to authenticate itself. It does not directly affect (to any great
extent) the way the Samba server does security. I know this is
strange, but it fits in with the client/server approach of SMB. In SMB
everything is initiated and controlled by the client, and the server
can only tell the client what is available and whether an action is
allowed. </P
><P
>I'll describe user level security first, as its simpler. In user level
security the client will send a "session setup" command directly after
the protocol negotiation. This contains a username and password. The
server can either accept or reject that username/password
combination. Note that at this stage the server has no idea what
share the client will eventually try to connect to, so it can't base
the "accept/reject" on anything other than:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>the username/password</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>the machine that the client is coming from</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>If the server accepts the username/password then the client expects to
be able to mount any share (using a "tree connection") without
specifying a password. It expects that all access rights will be as
the username/password specified in the "session setup". </P
><P
>It is also possible for a client to send multiple "session setup"
requests. When the server responds it gives the client a "uid" to use
as an authentication tag for that username/password. The client can
maintain multiple authentication contexts in this way (WinDD is an
example of an application that does this)</P
><P
>Ok, now for share level security. In share level security the client
authenticates itself separately for each share. It will send a
password along with each "tree connection" (share mount). It does not
explicitly send a username with this operation. The client is
expecting a password to be associated with each share, independent of
the user. This means that samba has to work out what username the
client probably wants to use. It is never explicitly sent the
username. Some commercial SMB servers such as NT actually associate
passwords directly with shares in share level security, but samba
always uses the unix authentication scheme where it is a
username/password that is authenticated, not a "share/password".</P
><P
>Many clients send a "session setup" even if the server is in share
level security. They normally send a valid username but no
password. Samba records this username in a list of "possible
usernames". When the client then does a "tree connection" it also adds
to this list the name of the share they try to connect to (useful for
home directories) and any users listed in the "user =" smb.conf
line. The password is then checked in turn against these "possible
usernames". If a match is found then the client is authenticated as
that user.</P
><P
>Finally "server level" security. In server level security the samba
server reports to the client that it is in user level security. The
client then does a "session setup" as described earlier. The samba
server takes the username/password that the client sends and attempts
to login to the "password server" by sending exactly the same
username/password that it got from the client. If that server is in
user level security and accepts the password then samba accepts the
clients connection. This allows the samba server to use another SMB
server as the "password server". </P
><P
>You should also note that at the very start of all this, where the
server tells the client what security level it is in, it also tells
the client if it supports encryption. If it does then it supplies the
client with a random "cryptkey". The client will then send all
passwords in encrypted form. You have to compile samba with encryption
enabled to support this feature, and you have to maintain a separate
smbpasswd file with SMB style encrypted passwords. It is
cryptographically impossible to translate from unix style encryption
to SMB style encryption, although there are some fairly simple management
schemes by which the two could be kept in sync.</P

a Windows 2000 Domain.  Samba 2.2 is able to act as a member server of a Windows
2000 domain operating in mixed or native mode.</P

>There is much confusion between the circumstances that require a "mixed" mode
Win2k DC and a when this host can be switched to "native" mode.  A "mixed" mode
Win2k domain controller is only needed if Windows NT BDCs must exist in the same

CLASS="CONSTANT"
>DOM\fred
	</TT

	to be a local Unix user fred to represent that user in the Unix

	<A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html#SECURITYEQUALSSERVER"

	assign UNIX uids and gids to Windows NT Domain users and groups.
	This code is available in development branches only at the moment,
	but will be moved to release branches soon.</P
><P
>The advantage to domain-level security is that the 
	authentication in domain-level security is passed down the authenticated 
	RPC channel in exactly the same way that an NT server would do it. This 
	means Samba servers now participate in domain trust relationships in 
	exactly the same way NT servers do (i.e., you can add Samba servers into 
	a resource domain and have the authentication passed on from a resource
	domain PDC to an account domain PDC.</P
><P
>In addition, with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>security = server</B

	daemon on a server has to keep a connection open to the 
	authenticating server for as long as that daemon lasts. This can drain 
	the connection resources on a Microsoft NT server and cause it to run 
	out of available connections. With <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>security = domain</B
>, 
	however, the Samba daemons connect to the PDC/BDC only for as long 
	as is necessary to authenticate the user, and then drop the connection, 
	thus conserving PDC connection resources.</P
><P
>And finally, acting in the same manner as an NT server 
	authenticating to a PDC means that as part of the authentication 
	reply, the Samba server gets the user identification information such 
	as the user SID, the list of NT groups the user belongs to, etc. All 
	this information will allow Samba to be extended in the future into 
	a mode the developers currently call appliance mode. In this mode, 
	no local Unix users will be necessary, and Samba will generate Unix 
	uids and gids from the information passed back from the PDC when a 
	user is authenticated, making a Samba server truly plug and play 
	in an NT domain environment. Watch for this code soon.</P

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>winbind</I

	uses a UNIX implementation

	Service Switch to allow Windows NT domain users to appear and operate 
	as UNIX users on a UNIX machine. This paper describes the winbind

NAME="AEN1398">Introduction</H2
><P
>It is well known that UNIX and Microsoft Windows NT have 
	different models for representing user and group information and 
	use different technologies for implementing them. This fact has 
	made it difficult to integrate the two systems in a satisfactory 
	manner.</P
><P
>One common solution in use today has been to create 
	identically named user accounts on both the UNIX and Windows systems 
	and use the Samba suite of programs to provide file and print services 
	between the two. This solution is far from perfect however, as 
	adding and deleting users on both sets of machines becomes a chore 
	and two sets of passwords are required both of which
	can lead to synchronization problems between the UNIX and Windows 
	systems and confusion for users.</P
><P
>We divide the unified logon problem for UNIX machines into 
	three smaller problems:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Obtaining Windows NT user and group information
		</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Authenticating Windows NT users
		</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Password changing for Windows NT users
		</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Ideally, a prospective solution to the unified logon problem 
	would satisfy all the above components without duplication of 
	information on the UNIX machines and without creating additional 
	tasks for the system administrator when maintaining users and 
	groups on either system. The winbind system provides a simple 
	and elegant solution to all three components of the unified logon 
	problem.</P

NAME="AEN1411">What Winbind Provides</H2
><P
>Winbind unifies UNIX and Windows NT account management by 
	allowing a UNIX box to become a full member of a NT domain. Once 
	this is done the UNIX box will see NT users and groups as if 
	they were native UNIX users and groups, allowing the NT domain 
	to be used in much the same manner that NIS+ is used within 
	UNIX-only environments.</P
><P
>The end result is that whenever any 
	program on the UNIX machine asks the operating system to lookup 
	a user or group name, the query will be resolved by asking the 
	NT domain controller for the specified domain to do the lookup.
	Because Winbind hooks into the operating system at a low level 
	(via the NSS name resolution modules in the C library) this 
	redirection to the NT domain controller is completely 
	transparent.</P
><P
>Users on the UNIX machine can then use NT user and group 
	names as they would use "native" UNIX names. They can chown files 
	so that they are owned by NT domain users or even login to the 
	UNIX machine and run a UNIX X-Window session as a domain user.</P
><P
>The only obvious indication that Winbind is being used is 
	that user and group names take the form DOMAIN\user and 
	DOMAIN\group. This is necessary as it allows Winbind to determine 
	that redirection to a domain controller is wanted for a particular 
	lookup and which trusted domain is being referenced.</P
><P
>Additionally, Winbind provides an authentication service 
	that hooks into the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) system 
	to provide authentication via a NT domain to any PAM enabled 
	applications. This capability solves the problem of synchronizing 
	passwords between systems since all passwords are stored in a single 
	location (on the domain controller).</P

		maintain a separate account infrastructure. This greatly 
		simplifies the administrative overhead of deploying UNIX 
		workstations into a NT based organization.</P
><P
>Another interesting way in which we expect Winbind to 
		be used is as a central part of UNIX based appliances. Appliances

		the Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC) system. This 
		system is used for most network related operations between 
		Windows NT machines including remote management, user authentication
		and print spooling. Although initially this work was done 
		to aid the implementation of Primary Domain Controller (PDC) 
		functionality in Samba, it has also yielded a body of code which 
		can be used for other purposes.</P
><P
>Winbind uses various MSRPC calls to enumerate domain users 
		and groups and to obtain detailed information about individual 
		users or groups. Other MSRPC calls can be used to authenticate 
		NT domain users and to change user passwords. By directly querying 
		a Windows PDC for user and group information, winbind maps the 
		NT account information onto UNIX user and group names.</P

NAME="AEN1431">Name Service Switch</H3
><P
>The Name Service Switch, or NSS, is a feature that is 
		present in many UNIX operating systems. It allows system 
		information such as hostnames, mail aliases and user information 
		to be resolved from different sources. For example, a standalone 
		UNIX workstation may resolve system information from a series of 
		flat files stored on the local filesystem. A networked workstation 
		may first attempt to resolve system information from local files, 
		and then consult a NIS database for user information or a DNS server 
		for hostname information.</P
><P
>The NSS application programming interface allows winbind 
		to present itself as a source of system information when 
		resolving UNIX usernames and groups.  Winbind uses this interface, 
		and information obtained from a Windows NT server using MSRPC 
		calls to provide a new source of account enumeration.  Using standard 
		UNIX library calls, one can enumerate the users and groups on
		a UNIX machine running winbind and see all users and groups in 
		a NT domain plus any trusted domain as though they were local 
		users and groups.</P
><P
>The primary control file for NSS is 
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

		When a UNIX application makes a request to do a lookup 
		the C library looks in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

		for a line which matches the service type being requested, for 
		example the "passwd" service type is used when user or group names 
		are looked up. This	config line species which implementations

		config line is:</P

		C library will dynamically load each of these modules in turn 
		and call resolver functions within the modules to try to resolve 
		the request. Once the request is resolved the C library returns the
		result to the application.</P

>Pluggable Authentication Modules, also known as PAM, 
		is a system for abstracting authentication and authorization 
		technologies. With a PAM module it is possible to specify different 
		authentication methods for different system applications without 
		having to recompile these applications. PAM is also useful
		for implementing a particular policy for authorization. For example, 
		a system administrator may only allow console logins from users 
		stored in the local password file but only allow users resolved from 
		a NIS database to log in over the network.</P
><P
>Winbind uses the authentication management and password 
		management PAM interface to integrate Windows NT users into a

>An active system can generate a lot of user and group

		uses a caching scheme based on the SAM sequence number supplied 
		by NT domain controllers.  User or group information returned 
		by a PDC is cached by winbind along with a sequence number also 
		returned by the PDC. This sequence number is incremented by 
		Windows NT whenever any user or group information is modified. If 
		a cached entry has expired, the sequence number is requested from 
		the PDC and compared against the sequence number of the cached entry. 
		If the sequence numbers do not match, then the cached information 
		is discarded and up to date information is requested directly

>To allow Domain users the ability to access SAMBA shares and 
files, as well as potentially other services provided by your 
SAMBA machine, PAM (pluggable authentication modules) must
be setup properly on your machine.  In order to compile the 
winbind modules, you should have at least the pam libraries resident 
on your system.  For recent RedHat systems (7.1, for instance), that 
means <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pam-0.74-22</TT
>.  For best results, it is helpful to also
install the development packages in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pam-devel-0.74-22</TT
>.</P

authenticate a client machine (rather than a user) to the Samba
server.  In Windows terminology, this is known as a "Computer
Account."</P
><P
>The password of a machine trust account acts as the shared secret for
secure communication with the Domain Controller.  This is a security
feature to prevent an unauthorized machine with the same NetBIOS name
from joining the domain and gaining access to domain user/group
accounts.  Windows NT and 2000 clients use machine trust accounts, but
Windows 9x clients do not.  Hence, a Windows 9x client is never a true
member of a domain because it does not possess a machine trust
account, and thus has no shared secret with the domain controller.</P

Registry.  A Samba PDC, however, stores each machine trust account 
in two parts, as follows:

<P

    LanMan and NT password hashes (currently

	You can use the -d option for both smbd and nmbd to specify what 
	'debug level' at which to run.  See the man pages on smbd, nmbd  and 
	smb.conf for more information on debugging options.  The debug 
	level can range from 1 (the default) to 10 (100 for debugging passwords).
	</P
><P
>	Another helpful method of debugging is to compile samba using the 
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc -g </B
> flag.   This will include debug 
	information in the binaries and allow you to attach gdb to the 
	running smbd / nmbd process.  In order to attach gdb to an smbd 
	process for an NT workstation, first get the workstation to make the 
	connection. Pressing ctrl-alt-delete and going down to the domain box 
	is sufficient (at least, on the first time you join the domain) to 
	generate a 'LsaEnumTrustedDomains'. Thereafter, the workstation 
	maintains an open connection, and therefore there will be an smbd 
	process running (assuming that you haven't set a really short smbd 
	idle timeout)  So, in between pressing ctrl alt delete, and actually 
	typing in your password, you can gdb attach and continue.

>A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same thing in terms of network
browsing.  The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network.  Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server (NT server and 
other systems based on NT server support this, as does at least Samba TNG now).</P
><P
>The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is
identical and is explained in BROWSING.txt. It should be noted, that browsing
is totally orthogonal to logon support.</P
><P
>Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
section.  Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts, and user
profiles for MS Windows for workgroups and MS Windows 9X/ME clients
which will be the focus of this section.</P
><P
>When an SMB client in a domain wishes to logon it broadcast requests for a
logon server.  The first one to reply gets the job, and validates its
password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but very stupid) to create a domain where the user
database is not shared between servers, i.e. they are effectively workgroup
servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain.  This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely
involved with domains.</P
><P
>Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server; make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.</P
><P
>Before launching into the configuration instructions, it is 
worthwhile lookingat how a Windows 9x/ME client performs a logon:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>	The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
	a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS name DOMAIN&#60;1c&#62; at the
	NetBIOS layer.  The client chooses the first response it receives, which
	contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
	\\SERVER.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to that server, logs on (does an SMBsessetupX) and
	then connects to the IPC$ share (using an SMBtconX).
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then does a NetWkstaUserLogon request, which retrieves the name
	of the user's logon script. 
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to the NetLogon share and searches for this 	
	and if it is found and can be read, is retrieved and executed by the client.
	After this, the client disconnects from the NetLogon share.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then sends a NetUserGetInfo request to the server, to retrieve
	the user's home share, which is used to search for profiles. Since the
	response to the NetUserGetInfo request does not contain much more 	
	the user's home share, profiles for Win9X clients MUST reside in the user
	home directory.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to the user's home share and searches for the 
	user's profile. As it turns out, you can specify the user's home share as

	If the profiles are found, they are implemented.
	</P
></LI

>There are a few comments to make in order to tie up some 
loose ends.  There has been much debate over the issue of whether
or not it is ok to configure Samba as a Domain Controller in security
modes other than <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>USER</TT
>.  The only security mode 
which  will not work due to technical reasons is <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>SHARE</TT
>
mode security.  <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>DOMAIN</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>SERVER</TT
>
mode security is really just a variation on SMB user level security.</P
><P
>Actually, this issue is also closely tied to the debate on whether 
or not Samba must be the domain master browser for its workgroup
when operating as a DC.  While it may technically be possible
to configure a server as such (after all, browsing and domain logons
are two distinctly different functions), it is not a good idea to
so.  You should remember that the DC must register the DOMAIN#1b NetBIOS 
name.  This is the name used by Windows clients to locate the DC.
Windows clients do not distinguish between the DC and the DMB.
For this reason, it is very wise to configure the Samba DC as the DMB.</P
><P
>Now back to the issue of configuring a Samba DC to use a mode other
than "security = user".  If a Samba host is configured to use 
another SMB server or DC in order to validate user connection 
requests, then it is a fact that some other machine on the network 
(the "password server") knows more about user than the Samba host.
99% of the time, this other host is a domain controller.  Now 
in order to operate in domain mode security, the "workgroup" parameter
must be set to the name of the Windows NT domain (which already 
has a domain controller, right?)</P
><P
>Therefore configuring a Samba box as a DC for a domain that 
already by definition has a PDC is asking for trouble.
Therefore, you should always configure the Samba DC to be the DMB
for its domain.</P

The term "Domain Controller" and those related to it refer to one specific
method of authentication that can underly an SMB domain. Domain Controllers
prior to Windows NT Server 3.1 were sold by various companies and based on 
private extensions to the LAN Manager 2.1 protocol. Windows NT introduced
Microsoft-specific ways of distributing the user authentication database.
See DOMAIN.txt for examples of how Samba can participate in or create
SMB domains based on shared authentication database schemes other than the 
Windows NT SAM.</P
><P
>Windows NT Server can be installed as either a plain file and print server
(WORKGROUP workstation or server) or as a server that participates in Domain
Control (DOMAIN member, Primary Domain controller or Backup Domain controller).
The same is true for OS/2 Warp Server, Digital Pathworks and other similar
products, all of which can participate in Domain Control along with Windows NT.</P
><P
>To many people these terms can be confusing, so let's try to clear the air.</P
><P
>Every Windows NT system (workstation or server) has a registry database.
The registry contains entries that describe the initialization information
for all services (the equivalent of Unix Daemons) that run within the Windows
NT environment. The registry also contains entries that tell application
software where to find dynamically loadable libraries that they depend upon.
In fact, the registry contains entries that describes everything that anything
may need to know to interact with the rest of the system.</P
><P
>The registry files can be located on any Windows NT machine by opening a
command prompt and typing:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>C:\WINNT\&#62;</TT
> dir %SystemRoot%\System32\config</P
><P
>The environment variable %SystemRoot% value can be obtained by typing:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>C:\WINNT&#62;</TT
>echo %SystemRoot%</P
><P
>The active parts of the registry that you may want to be familiar with are
the files called: default, system, software, sam and security.</P
><P
>In a domain environment, Microsoft Windows NT domain controllers participate
in replication of the SAM and SECURITY files so that all controllers within
the domain have an exactly identical copy of each.</P
><P
>The Microsoft Windows NT system is structured within a security model that
says that all applications and services must authenticate themselves before
they can obtain permission from the security manager to do what they set out
to do.</P
><P
>The Windows NT User database also resides within the registry. This part of
the registry contains the user's security identifier, home directory, group
memberships, desktop profile, and so on.</P
><P
>Every Windows NT system (workstation as well as server) will have its own
registry. Windows NT Servers that participate in Domain Security control
have a database that they share in common - thus they do NOT own an
independent full registry database of their own, as do Workstations and
plain Servers.</P
><P
>The User database is called the SAM (Security Access Manager) database and
is used for all user authentication as well as for authentication of inter-
process authentication (i.e. to ensure that the service action a user has
requested is permitted within the limits of that user's privileges).</P
><P
>The Samba team have produced a utility that can dump the Windows NT SAM into 
smbpasswd format: see ENCRYPTION.txt for information on smbpasswd and
/pub/samba/pwdump on your nearest Samba mirror for the utility. This 
facility is useful but cannot be easily used to implement SAM replication
to Samba systems.</P
><P
>Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT Workstations and Servers
can participate in a Domain security system that is controlled by Windows NT
servers that have been correctly configured. Almost every domain will have
ONE Primary Domain Controller (PDC). It is desirable that each domain will
have at least one Backup Domain Controller (BDC).</P
><P
>The PDC and BDCs then participate in replication of the SAM database so that
each Domain Controlling participant will have an up to date SAM component
within its registry.</P

>What is a Domain Controller? It is a machine that is able to answer
logon requests from workstations in a Windows NT Domain. Whenever a
user logs into a Windows NT Workstation, the workstation connects to a
Domain Controller and asks him whether the username and password the
user typed in is correct.  The Domain Controller replies with a lot of
information about the user, for example the place where the users
profile is stored, the users full name of the user. All this
information is stored in the NT user database, the so-called SAM.</P
><P
>There are two kinds of Domain Controller in a NT 4 compatible Domain:
A Primary Domain Controller (PDC) and one or more Backup Domain
Controllers (BDC). The PDC contains the master copy of the
SAM. Whenever the SAM has to change, for example when a user changes
his password, this change has to be done on the PDC. A Backup Domain
Controller is a machine that maintains a read-only copy of the
SAM. This way it is able to reply to logon requests and authenticate
users in case the PDC is not available. During this time no changes to
the SAM are possible. Whenever changes to the SAM are done on the PDC,
all BDC receive the changes from the PDC.</P
><P
>Since version 2.2 Samba officially supports domain logons for all
current Windows Clients, including Windows 2000 and XP. This text
assumes the domain to be named SAMBA. To be able to act as a PDC, some
parameters in the [global]-section of the smb.conf have to be set:</P

><P
>Every machine that is a Domain Controller for the domain SAMBA has to
register the NetBIOS group name SAMBA#1c with the WINS server and/or
by broadcast on the local network. The PDC also registers the unique
NetBIOS name SAMBA#1b with the WINS server. The name type #1b is
normally reserved for the domain master browser, a role that has
nothing to do with anything related to authentication, but the
Microsoft Domain implementation requires the domain master browser to
be on the same machine as the PDC.</P

NAME="AEN2302">How does a Workstation find its domain controller?</H3
><P
>A NT workstation in the domain SAMBA that wants a local user to be
authenticated has to find the domain controller for SAMBA. It does
this by doing a NetBIOS name query for the group name SAMBA#1c. It
assumes that each of the machines it gets back from the queries is a
domain controller and can answer logon requests. To not open security
holes both the workstation and the selected (TODO: How is the DC
chosen) domain controller authenticate each other. After that the
workstation sends the user's credentials (his name and password) to
the domain controller, asking for approval.</P

SAM. The workstation contacts the PDC, both mutually authenticate and
the password change is done.</P

></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The domain SID has to be the same on the PDC and the BDC. This used to
be stored in the file private/MACHINE.SID. This file is not created
anymore since Samba 2.2.5 or even earlier. Nowadays the domain SID is
stored in the file private/secrets.tdb. Simply copying the secrets.tdb
from the PDC to the BDC does not work, as the BDC would
generate a new SID for itself and override the domain SID with this
new BDC SID.</P
><P
>To retrieve the domain SID from the PDC or an existing BDC and store it in the
secrets.tdb, execute 'net rpc getsid' on the BDC.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The Unix user database has to be synchronized from the PDC to the
BDC. This means that both the /etc/passwd and /etc/group have to be
replicated from the PDC to the BDC. This can be done manually
whenever changes are made, or the PDC is set up as a NIS master
server and the BDC as a NIS slave server. To set up the BDC as a
mere NIS client would not be enough, as the BDC would not be able to
access its user database in case of a PDC failure.</P

replicated from the PDC to the BDC. This is a bit tricky, see the
next section.</P

only register the name SAMBA#1c with the WINS server. This is no
problem as the name SAMBA#1c is a NetBIOS group name that is meant to
be registered by more than one machine. The parameter 'domain master =
no' forces the BDC not to register SAMBA#1b which as a unique NetBIOS
name is reserved for the Primary Domain Controller.</P

NAME="AEN2329">How do I replicate the smbpasswd file?</H3
><P
>Replication of the smbpasswd file is sensitive. It has to be done
whenever changes to the SAM are made. Every user's password change is
done in the smbpasswd file and has to be replicated to the BDC. So
replicating the smbpasswd file very often is necessary.</P
><P
>As the smbpasswd file contains plain text password equivalents, it
must not be sent unencrypted over the wire. The best way to set up
smbpasswd replication from the PDC to the BDC is to use the utility
rsync. rsync can use ssh as a transport. ssh itself can be set up to
accept *only* rsync transfer without requiring the user to type a
password.</P

is a performance bottleneck for lareg sites.  What is needed is an indexed approach
such as is used in databases.</P

a home directory, password expiration time, or even a Relative

><P
>As a result of these defeciencies, a more robust means of storing user attributes
used by smbd was developed.  The API which defines access to user accounts
is commonly referred to as the samdb interface (previously this was called the passdb
API, and is still so named in the CVS trees). In Samba 2.2.3, enabling support
for a samdb backend (e.g. <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"

<TT

option, smbd (and associated tools) will store and lookup user accounts in
an LDAP directory.  In reality, this is very easy to understand.  If you are
comfortable with using an smbpasswd file, simply replace "smbpasswd" with
"LDAP directory" in all the documentation.</P

with the posixAccount objectclass outlined in RFC2307.  This is by design.</P

>In order to store all user account information (UNIX and Samba) in the directory,
it is necessary to use the sambaAccount and posixAccount objectclasses in
combination.  However, smbd will still obtain the user's UNIX account
information via the standard C library calls (e.g. getpwnam(), et. al.).
This means that the Samba server must also have the LDAP NSS library installed
and functioning correctly.  This division of information makes it possible to
store all Samba account information in LDAP, but still maintain UNIX account
information in NIS while the network is transitioning to a full LDAP infrastructure.</P

NAME="AEN2577">Overview of browsing</H2
><P
>SMB networking provides a mechanism by which clients can access a list
of machines in a network, a so-called "browse list".  This list
contains machines that are ready to offer file and/or print services
to other machines within the network. Thus it does not include
machines which aren't currently able to do server tasks.  The browse
list is heavily used by all SMB clients.  Configuration of SMB
browsing has been problematic for some Samba users, hence this
document.</P
><P
>Browsing will NOT work if name resolution from NetBIOS names to IP
addresses does not function correctly. Use of a WINS server is highly
recommended to aid the resolution of NetBIOS (SMB) names to IP addresses.
WINS allows remote segment clients to obtain NetBIOS name_type information
that can NOT be provided by any other means of name resolution.</P

NAME="AEN2581">Browsing support in samba</H2
><P
>Samba now fully supports browsing.  The browsing is supported by nmbd
and is also controlled by options in the smb.conf file (see smb.conf(5)).</P
><P
>Samba can act as a local browse master for a workgroup and the ability
for samba to support domain logons and scripts is now available.  See
DOMAIN.txt for more information on domain logons.</P
><P
>Samba can also act as a domain master browser for a workgroup.  This
means that it will collate lists from local browse masters into a
wide area network server list.  In order for browse clients to
resolve the names they may find in this list, it is recommended that
both samba and your clients use a WINS server.</P
><P
>Note that you should NOT set Samba to be the domain master for a
workgroup that has the same name as an NT Domain: on each wide area
network, you must only ever have one domain master browser per workgroup,
regardless of whether it is NT, Samba or any other type of domain master
that is providing this service.</P
><P
>[Note that nmbd can be configured as a WINS server, but it is not
necessary to specifically use samba as your WINS server.  NTAS can
be configured as your WINS server.  In a mixed NT server and
samba environment on a Wide Area Network, it is recommended that
you use the NT server's WINS server capabilities.  In a samba-only
environment, it is recommended that you use one and only one nmbd
as your WINS server].</P
><P
>To get browsing to work you need to run nmbd as usual, but will need
to use the "workgroup" option in smb.conf to control what workgroup
Samba becomes a part of.</P
><P
>Samba also has a useful option for a Samba server to offer itself for
browsing on another subnet.  It is recommended that this option is only
used for 'unusual' purposes: announcements over the internet, for
example.  See "remote announce" in the smb.conf man page.  </P

><P
>If something doesn't work then hopefully the log.nmb file will help
you track down the problem.  Try a debug level of 2 or 3 for finding
problems. Also note that the current browse list usually gets stored
in text form in a file called browse.dat.</P
><P
>Note that if it doesn't work for you, then you should still be able to
type the server name as \\SERVER in filemanager then hit enter and
filemanager should display the list of available shares.</P
><P
>Some people find browsing fails because they don't have the global
"guest account" set to a valid account.  Remember that the IPC$
connection that lists the shares is done as guest, and thus you must
have a valid guest account.</P
><P
>Also, a lot of people are getting bitten by the problem of too many
parameters on the command line of nmbd in inetd.conf.  This trick is to
not use spaces between the option and the parameter (eg: -d2 instead
of -d 2), and to not use the -B and -N options.  New versions of nmbd
are now far more likely to correctly find your broadcast and network
address, so in most cases these aren't needed.</P
><P

netmask or IP address is wrong (specified with the "interfaces" option
in smb.conf)</P

NAME="AEN2597">Browsing across subnets</H2
><P
>With the release of Samba 1.9.17(alpha1 and above) Samba has been
updated to enable it to support the replication of browse lists
across subnet boundaries.  New code and options have been added to
achieve this.  This section describes how to set this feature up
in different settings.</P
><P
>To see browse lists that span TCP/IP subnets (ie.  networks separated
by routers that don't pass broadcast traffic) you must set up at least
one WINS server.  The WINS server acts as a DNS for NetBIOS names, allowing
NetBIOS name to IP address translation to be done by doing a direct
query of the WINS server.  This is done via a directed UDP packet on
port 137 to the WINS server machine.  The reason for a WINS server is
that by default, all NetBIOS name to IP address translation is done
by broadcasts from the querying machine.  This means that machines
on one subnet will not be able to resolve the names of machines on
another subnet without using a WINS server.</P
><P
>Remember, for browsing across subnets to work correctly, all machines,
be they Windows 95, Windows NT, or Samba servers must have the IP address
of a WINS server given to them by a DHCP server, or by manual configuration 
(for Win95 and WinNT, this is in the TCP/IP Properties, under Network 
settings) for Samba this is in the smb.conf file.</P

However, with the 1.9.17 release, Samba is capable of cross subnet

on it, subnet 2 has 4 machines, subnet 3 has 4 machines.  Assume
for the moment that all these machines are configured to be in the
same workgroup (for simplicities sake).  Machine N1_C on subnet 1
is configured as Domain Master Browser (ie.  it will collate the
browse lists for the workgroup).  Machine N2_D is configured as

N1_C wins on subnet 1, N2_B wins on subnet 2, and N3_D wins on

their particular subnet.  N1_C has an advantage in winning as the
local master browser on subnet 1 as it is set up as Domain Master
Browser.</P
><P
>On each of the three networks, machines that are configured to 
offer sharing services will broadcast that they are offering
these services.  The local master browser on each subnet will
receive these broadcasts and keep a record of the fact that
the machine is offering a service.  This list of records is
the basis of the browse list.  For this case, assume that
all the machines are configured to offer services so all machines
will be on the browse list.</P
><P
>For each network, the local master browser on that network is
considered 'authoritative' for all the names it receives via
local broadcast.  This is because a machine seen by the local
master browser via a local broadcast must be on the same 
network as the local master browser and thus is a 'trusted'
and 'verifiable' resource.  Machines on other networks that
the local master browsers learn about when collating their
browse lists have not been directly seen - these records are
called 'non-authoritative'.</P

tells the Domain Master Browser to send it all the server

request to the sender of that packet.  After both synchronizations

If this is not done, then the Windows 2000 SP2 client will

DOMAIN.user.002, etc...).  See the

bug. Samba is maintained by a dedicated group of people who volunteer
their time, skills and efforts. We receive far more mail about it than
we can possibly answer, so you have a much higher chance of an answer
and a fix if you send us a "developer friendly" bug report that lets
us fix it fast. </P

newsgroup or the mailing list that we will read it. If you suspect that your 
problem is not a bug but a configuration problem then it is better to send 
it to the Samba mailing list, as there are (at last count) 5000 other users on
that list that may be able to help you.</P

>If the bug has anything to do with Samba behaving incorrectly as a
server (like refusing to open a file) then the log files will probably
be very useful. Depending on the problem a log level of between 3 and
10 showing the problem may be appropriate. A higher level givesmore
detail, but may use too much disk space.</P
><P
>To set the debug level use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>log level =</B
> in your 
<TT

>smb.conf</TT
>. You may also find it useful to set the log 
level higher for just one machine and keep separate logs for each machine. 
To do this use:</P

><P
>then create a file 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf.machine</TT
> where
"machine" is the name of the client you wish to debug. In that file
put any smb.conf commands you want, for example 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>log level=</B

experiment with different security systems, protocol levels etc on just 
one machine.</P
><P
>The <TT

used in older versions of Samba and is being retained for backwards 
compatibility of smb.conf files.</P
><P
>As the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>log level =</B

a significantly increasing level of debugging information. For most 
debugging operations you may not need a setting higher than 3. Nearly 
all bugs can be tracked at a setting of 10, but be prepared for a VERY 
large volume of log data.</P

a message which details the last SMB message received by smbd. This

possible. Please make this reasonably detailed.</P

don't have gdb then try "dbx". Then within the debugger use the
command "where" to give a stack trace of where the problem
occurred. Include this in your mail.</P

where the problem occurred (if its in a library routine then
disassemble the routine that called it) and try to work out exactly
where the problem is by looking at the surrounding code. Even if you
don't know assembly then incuding this info in the bug report can be

NAME="GROUPMAPPING">Group mapping HOWTO</H1
><P
> 
Starting with Samba 3.0 alpha 2, a new group mapping function is available. The
current method (likely to change) to manage the groups is a new command called
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbgroupedit</B
>.</P
><P
>The first immediate reason to use the group mapping on a PDC, is that
the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>domain admin group</B
> of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
> is 
now gone. This parameter was used to give the listed users local admin rights 
on their workstations. It was some magic stuff that simply worked but didn't
scale very well for complex setups.</P
><P
>Let me explain how it works on NT/W2K, to have this magic fade away.
When installing NT/W2K on a computer, the installer program creates some users
and groups. Notably the 'Administrators' group, and gives to that group some
privileges like the ability to change the date and time or to kill any process
(or close too) running on the local machine. The 'Administrator' user is a
member of the 'Administrators' group, and thus 'inherit' the 'Administrators'
group privileges. If a 'joe' user is created and become a member of the
'Administrator' group, 'joe' has exactly the same rights as 'Administrator'.</P
><P
>When a NT/W2K machine is joined to a domain, during that phase, the "Domain
Administrators' group of the PDC is added to the 'Administrators' group of the
workstation. Every members of the 'Domain Administrators' group 'inherit' the
rights of the 'Administrators' group when logging on the workstation.</P
><P
>You are now wondering how to make some of your samba PDC users members of the
'Domain Administrators' ? That's really easy.</P

>Like the Domain Admins group, you can map any arbitrary Unix group to any NT
group. You can also make any Unix group a domain group. For example, on a domain
member machine (an NT/W2K or a samba server running winbind), you would like to
give access to a certain directory to some users who are member of a group on
your samba PDC. Flag that group as a domain group by running:</P

>HP's implementation of supplementary groups is, er, non-standard (for
hysterical reasons).  There are two group files, /etc/group and
/etc/logingroup; the system maps UIDs to numbers using the former, but
initgroups() reads the latter.  Most system admins who know the ropes
symlink /etc/group to /etc/logingroup (hard link doesn't work for reasons
too stupid to go into here).  initgroups() will complain if one of the
groups you're in in /etc/logingroup has what it considers to be an invalid
ID, which means outside the range [0..UID_MAX], where UID_MAX is (I think)
60000 currently on HP-UX.  This precludes -2 and 65534, the usual 'nobody'
GIDs.</P
