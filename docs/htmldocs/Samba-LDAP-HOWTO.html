><P
>This document describes how to use an LDAP directory for storing Samba user
account information normally stored in the smbpasswd(5) file.  It is
assumed that the reader already has a basic understanding of LDAP concepts
and has a working directory server already installed.  For more information
on LDAP architectures and Directories, please refer to the following sites.</P

>Traditionally, when configuring <A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html#ENCRYPTPASSWORDS"
TARGET="_top"
>"encrypt
passwords = yes"</A
> in Samba's <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
> file, user account
information such as username, LM/NT password hashes, password change times, and account
flags have been stored in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smbpasswd(5)</TT
> file.  There are several
disadvantages to this approach for sites with very large numbers of users (counted
in the thousands).</P
><P
>The first is that all lookups must be performed sequentially.  Given that
there are approximately two lookups per domain logon (one for a normal
session connection such as when mapping a network drive or printer), this
is non-optimal.  What is needed is an indexed approach such as is used in
databases.</P
><P
>The second problem is that administrators which desired to replicate an
smbpasswd file to more than one Samba server were left to use external
tools such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rsync(1)</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh(1)</B
>
and write custom, in-house scripts.</P
><P
>And finally, the amount of information which is stored in an
smbpasswd entry leaves no room for additional attributes such as
a home directory, password expiration time, or even a Relative
Identified (RID).</P
><P
>As a result of these defeciencies, a more robust means of storing user attributes
used by smbd was developed.  The API which defines access to user accounts
is referred to as the samdb interface (previously this was called the passdb
API, and is still so named in the CVS trees).  In Samba 2.2.3, enabling support
for a samdb backend (e.g. <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-ldapsam</I
></TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-tdbsam</I
></TT
>) requires compile time support.</P
><P
>When compiling Samba to include the <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-ldapsam</I
></TT
> autoconf
option, smbd (and associated tools) will store and lookup user accounts in
an LDAP directory.  In reality, this is very easy to understand.  If you are
comfortable with using an smbpasswd file, simply replace "smbpasswd" with
"LDAP directory" in all the documentation.</P
><P
>There are a few points to stress about what the <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-ldapsam</I
></TT
>
does not provide.  The LDAP support referred to in the this documentat does not
include:</P

><P
>A means of retrieving user account information from
	an Windows 2000 Active Directory server.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A means of replacing /etc/passwd.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The second item can be accomplished by using LDAP NSS and PAM modules.  LGPL
versions of these libraries can be obtained from PADL Software
(<A

>The LDAP samdb code in 2.2.3 has been developed and tested using the OpenLDAP
2.0 server and client libraries.  The same code should be able to work with
Netscape's Directory Server and client SDK. However, due to lack of testing
so far, there are bounds to be compile errors and bugs.  These should not be
hard to fix. If you are so inclined, please be sure to forward all pacthes to

submit the modified schema file as a patch to <A

><P
>Just as the smbpasswd file is mean to store information which supplements a
user's <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> entry, so is the sambaAccount object
meant to supplement the UNIX user account information.  A sambaAccount is a
<TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>STRUCTURAL</TT
> objectclass so it can be stored individually
in the directory.  However, there are several fields (e.g. uid) which overlap
with the posixAccount objectclass outlined in RFC2307.  This is by design.</P
><P
>In order to store all user account information (UNIX and Samba) in the directory,
it is necessary to use the sambaAccount and posixAccount objectclasses in
combination.  However, smbd will still obtain the user's UNIX account
information via the standard C library calls (e.g. getpwnam(), et. al.).
This means that the Samba server must also have the LDAP NSS library installed
and functioning correctly.  This division of information mkes it posible to
store all Samba account information in LDAP, but still maintain UNIX account
information in NIS while the network is transitioning to a full LDAP infratrsucture.</P
><P
>To include support for the sambaAccount object in an OpenLDAP directory
server, first copy the samba.schema file to slapd's configuration directory.</P

>Next, include the <TT

>.
The sambaAccount object contains two attributes which depend upon other schema
files.  The 'uid' attribute is defined in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cosine.schema</TT
> and
the 'displayName' attribute is defined in the <TT
