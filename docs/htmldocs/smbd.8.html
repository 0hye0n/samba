>DESCRIPTION</H2
><P
>This program is part of the Samba suite.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbd</B
> is the server daemon that 
	provides filesharing and printing services to Windows clients. 
	The server provides filespace and printer services to
	clients using the SMB (or CIFS) protocol. This is compatible 
	with the LanManager protocol, and can service LanManager 
	clients.  These include MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for 
	Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, 
	OS/2, DAVE for Macintosh, and smbfs for Linux.</P
><P
>An extensive description of the services that the 
	server can provide is given in the man page for the 
	configuration file controlling the attributes of those 
	services (see <A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf(5)
	</TT
></A
>.  This man page will not describe the 
	services, but will concentrate on the administrative aspects 
	of running the server.</P
><P
>Please note that there are significant security 
	implications to running this server, and the <A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf(5)</TT
></A
> 
	manpage should be regarded as mandatory reading before 
	proceeding with installation.</P
><P
>A session is created whenever a client requests one. 
	Each client gets a copy of the server for each session. This 
	copy then services all connections made by the client during 
	that session. When all connections from its client are closed, 
	the copy of the server for that client terminates.</P
><P
>The configuration file, and any files that it includes, 
	are automatically reloaded every minute, if they change.  You 
	can force a reload by sending a SIGHUP to the server.  Reloading 
	the configuration file will not affect connections to any service 
	that is already established.  Either the user will have to 
	disconnect from the service, or smbd killed and restarted.</P

>INSTALLATION</H2
><P
>The location of the server and its support files 
	is a matter for individual system administrators. The following 
	are thus suggestions only.</P
><P
>It is recommended that the server software be installed 
	under the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/samba/</TT
> hierarchy, 
	in a directory readable by all, writeable only by root. The server 
	program itself should be executable by all, as users may wish to 
	run the server themselves (in which case it will of course run 
	with their privileges).  The server should NOT be setuid. On some 
	systems it may be worthwhile to make smbd setgid to an empty group. 
	This is because some systems may have a security hole where daemon 
	processes that become a user can be attached to with a debugger. 
	Making the smbd file setgid to an empty group may prevent
	this hole from being exploited. This security hole and the suggested
	fix has only been confirmed on old versions (pre-kernel 2.0) of Linux
	at the time this was written. It is possible that this hole only
	exists in Linux, as testing on other systems has thus far shown them
	to be immune.</P
><P
>The server log files should be put in a directory readable and
	writeable only by root, as the log files may contain sensitive
	information.</P
><P
>The configuration file should be placed in a directory 
	readable and writeable only by root, as the configuration file 
	controls security for the services offered by the server. The 
	configuration file can be made readable by all if desired, but 
	this is not necessary for correct operation of the server and is 
	not recommended. A sample configuration file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf.sample
	</TT
> is supplied with the source to the server - this may 
	be renamed to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
> and modified to suit 
	your needs.</P

	the server will always be ready, so starting sessions will be
	faster. If run from a meta-daemon some memory will be saved and
	utilities such as the tcpd TCP-wrapper may be used for extra 
	security.  For serious use as file server it is recommended 
	that <B

>RUNNING THE SERVER AS A DAEMON</H2
><P
>To run the server as a daemon from the command 
	line, simply put the <EM
>-D</EM
> option on the 
	command line. There is no need to place an ampersand at 
	the end of the command line - the <EM
>-D</EM
> 
	option causes the server to detach itself from the tty 
	anyway.</P
><P
>Any user can run the server as a daemon (execute 
	permissions permitting, of course). This is useful for 
	testing purposes, and may even be useful as a temporary 
	substitute for something like ftp. When run this way, however, 
	the server will only have the privileges of the user who ran 
	it.</P
><P
>To ensure that the server is run as a daemon whenever 
	the machine is started, and to ensure that it runs as root 
	so that it can serve multiple clients, you will need to modify 
	the system startup files. Wherever appropriate (for example, in 
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/rc</TT
>), insert the following line, 
	substituting port number, log file location, configuration file 
	location and debug level as desired:</P

>/usr/local/samba/bin/smbd -D -l /var/adm/smblogs/log

	as a single space or TAB character.)</P
