	and can reply to NetBIOS over IP name service requests, like 
	those produced by SMB/CIFS clients such as Windows 95/98/ME, 
	Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP and LanManager clients. It also
	participates in the browsing protocols which make up the 
	Windows &quot;Network Neighborhood&quot; view.</p><p>SMB/CIFS clients, when they start up, may wish to 
	locate an SMB/CIFS server. That is, they wish to know what 
	IP number a specified host is using.</p><p>Amongst other services, <b>nmbd</b> will 
	listen for such requests, and if its own NetBIOS name is 
	specified it will respond with the IP number of the host it 
	is running on.  Its &quot;own NetBIOS name&quot; is by
	default the primary DNS name of the host it is running on, 
	but this can be overridden with the <span class="emphasis"><em>-n</em></span> 
	option (see OPTIONS below). Thus <b>nmbd</b> will 
	reply to broadcast queries for its own name(s). Additional
	names for <b>nmbd</b> to respond on can be set 
	via parameters in the <a href="smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf(5)</a> configuration file.</p><p><b>nmbd</b> can also be used as a WINS 
	(Windows Internet Name Server) server. What this basically means 
	is that it will act as a WINS database server, creating a 
	database from name registration requests that it receives and 
	replying to queries from clients for these names.</p><p>In addition, <b>nmbd</b> can act as a WINS 
	proxy, relaying broadcast queries from clients that do 
	not understand how to talk the WINS protocol to a WINS 
	server.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>OPTIONS</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">-D</span></dt><dd><p>If specified, this parameter causes 
		<b>nmbd</b> to operate as a daemon. That is, 
		it detaches itself and runs in the background, fielding 
		requests on the appropriate port. By default, <b>nmbd</b> 
		will operate as a daemon if launched from a command shell. 
		nmbd can also be operated from the <b>inetd</b> 
		meta-daemon, although this is not recommended.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-F</span></dt><dd><p>If specified, this parameter causes
		the main <b>nmbd</b> process to not daemonize,
		i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the terminal.
		Child processes are still created as normal to service
		each connection request, but the main process does not
		exit. This operation mode is suitable for running
		<b>nmbd</b> under process supervisors such
		as <b>supervise</b> and <b>svscan</b>
		from Daniel J. Bernstein's <b>daemontools</b>
		package, or the AIX process monitor.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-S</span></dt><dd><p>If specified, this parameter causes

		server to run &quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if the
		server is executed on the command line of a shell. Setting this
		parameter negates the implicit daemon mode when run from the
		command line. <b>nmbd</b> also logs to standard
		output, as if the <tt>-S</tt> parameter had been
		given. </p></dd><dt><span class="term">-h|--help</span></dt><dd><p>Print a summary of command line options.

investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for 
use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.</p><p>Note that specifying this parameter here will

	that SIGKILL (-9) <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> be used, except as a last
	resort, as this may leave the name database in an inconsistent state.
	The correct way to terminate <b>nmbd</b> is to send it
	a SIGTERM (-15) signal and wait for it to die on its own.</p><p><b>nmbd</b> will accept SIGHUP, which will cause
	it to dump out its namelists into the file <tt>namelist.debug
	</tt> in the <tt>/usr/local/samba/var/locks</tt>
	directory (or the <tt>var/locks</tt> directory configured
	under wherever Samba was configured to install itself). This will also
	cause <b>nmbd</b> to dump out its server database in
	the <tt>log.nmb</tt> file.</p><p>The debug log level of nmbd may be raised or lowered
	using <a href="smbcontrol.1.html">smbcontrol(1)</a> (SIGUSR[1|2] signals
	are no longer used since Samba 2.2). This is to allow
	transient problems to be diagnosed, whilst still running 
	at a normally low log level.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><h2>VERSION</h2><p>This man page is correct for version 3.0 of
