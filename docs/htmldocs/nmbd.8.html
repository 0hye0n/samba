>DESCRIPTION</H2
><P
>This program is part of the Samba suite.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nmbd</B
> is a server that understands 
	and can reply to NetBIOS over IP name service requests, like 
	those produced by SMBD/CIFS clients such as Windows 95/98/ME, 
	Windows NT, Windows 2000, and LanManager clients. It also
	participates in the browsing protocols which make up the 
	Windows "Network Neighborhood" view.</P
><P
>SMB/CIFS clients, when they start up, may wish to 
	locate an SMB/CIFS server. That is, they wish to know what 
	IP number a specified host is using.</P
><P
>Amongst other services, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nmbd</B
> will 
	listen for such requests, and if its own NetBIOS name is 
	specified it will respond with the IP number of the host it 
	is running on.  Its "own NetBIOS name" is by
	default the primary DNS name of the host it is running on, 
	but this can be overridden with the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>-n</I
> 
	option (see OPTIONS below). Thus <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nmbd</B
> will 
	reply to broadcast queries for its own name(s). Additional
	names for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nmbd</B
> to respond on can be set 
	via parameters in the <A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>	smb.conf(5)</TT
></A
> configuration file.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nmbd</B
> can also be used as a WINS 
	(Windows Internet Name Server) server. What this basically means 
	is that it will act as a WINS database server, creating a 
	database from name registration requests that it receives and 
	replying to queries from clients for these names.</P
><P
>In addition, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nmbd</B
> can act as a WINS 
	proxy, relaying broadcast queries from clients that do 
	not understand how to talk the WINS protocol to a WIN 
	server.</P

	that SIGKILL (-9) <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>NOT</I

	The correct way to terminate <B

	directory (or the <TT

	&lt;nmbd-pid&gt;</B
>) and lowered by sending it a
	SIGUSR2 (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>kill -USR2 &lt;nmbd-pid&gt;</B

	allow transient problems to be diagnosed, whilst still running at a 
	normally low log level.</P
