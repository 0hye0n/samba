Advanced MS Windows users are frequently perplexed when file, directory and share manipulation of
resources shared via Samba do not behave in the manner they might expect. MS Windows network
administrators are often confused regarding network access controls and what is the best way to
provide users with the type of access they need while protecting resources from the consequences
of untoward access capabilities.
</p><p>
Unix administrators frequently are not familiar with the MS Windows environment and in particular
have difficulty in visualizing what the MS Windows user wishes to achieve in attempts to set file
and directory access permissions. 
</p><p>
The problem lies in the differences in how file and directory permissions and controls work
between the two environments. This difference is one that Samba can not completely hide, even
though it does try to make the chasm transparent.
</p><p>
POSIX Access Control List technology has been available (along with Extended Attributes)
for Unix for many years, yet there is little evidence today of any significant use. This
explains to some extent the slow adoption of ACLs into commercial Linux products. MS Windows
administrators are astounded at this given that ACLs were a foundational capability of the now
decade old MS Windows NT operating system.
</p><p>
The purpose of this chapter is to present each of the points of control that are possible with
Samba-3 in the hope that this will help the network administrator to find the optimum method
for delivering the best environment for MS Windows desktop users.
</p><p>
This is an opportune point to mention that it should be borne in mind that Samba was created to
provide a means of interoperability and interchange of data between two operating environments
that are quite different. It was never the intent to make Unix/Linux like MS Windows NT. Instead
the purpose was an is to provide a sufficient level of exchange of data between the two environments.
What is available today extends well beyond early plans and expectations, yet the gap continues to
shrink.

	Samba offers a lot of flexibility in file system access management. These are the key access control
	facilities present in Samba today:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Samba Access Control Facilities</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Unix File and Directory Permissions</em></span>
		</p><p>
			Samba honours and implements Unix file system access controls. Users
			who access a Samba server will do so as a particular MS Windows user.
			This information is passed to the Samba server as part of the logon or
			connection setup process. Samba uses this user identity to validate
			whether or not the user should be given access to file system resources
			(files and directories). This chapter provides an overview for those
			to whom the Unix permissions and controls are a little strange or unknown.
			</p></li><li><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Samba Share Definitions</em></span>
		</p><p>
			In configuring share settings and controls in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file
			the network administrator can exercise over-rides to native file
			system permissions and behaviours. This can be handy and convenient
			to affect behaviour that is more like what MS Windows NT users expect
			but it is seldom the <span class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span> way to achieve this.
			The basic options and techniques are described herein.
			</p></li><li><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>Samba Share ACLs</em></span>
		</p><p>
			Just like it is possible in MS Windows NT to set ACLs on shares
			themselves, so it is possible to do this in Samba.
			Very few people make use of this facility, yet it remains on of the
			easiest ways to affect access controls (restrictions) and can often
			do so with minimum invasiveness compared with other methods.
			</p></li><li><p>
		<span class="emphasis"><em>MS Windows ACLs through Unix POSIX ACLs</em></span>
		</p><p>
			The use of POSIX ACLs on Unix/Linux is possible ONLY if the underlying
			operating system supports them. If not, then this option will not be
			available to you. Current Unix technology platforms have native support
			for POSIX ACLs. There are patches for the Linux kernel that provide
			this also. Sadly, few Linux platforms ship today with native ACLs and
			Extended Attributes enabled. This chapter has pertinent information
			for users of platforms that support them.
			</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2920364"></a>File System Access Controls</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Perhaps the most important recognition to be made is the simple fact that MS Windows NT4 / 200x / XP
implement a totally divergent file system technology from what is provided in the Unix operating system
environment. Firstly we should consider what the most significant differences are, then we shall look
at how Samba helps to bridge the differences.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2920382"></a>MS Windows NTFS Comparison with Unix File Systems</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	Samba operates on top of the Unix file system. This means it is subject to Unix file system conventions
	and permissions. It also means that if the MS Windows networking environment requires file system
	behaviour that differs from unix file system behaviour then somehow Samba is responsible for emulating
	that in a transparent and consistent manner.
	</p><p>
	It is good news that Samba does this to a very large extent and on top of that provides a high degree
	of optional configuration to over-ride the default behaviour. We will look at some of these over-rides,
	but for the greater part we will stay within the bounds of default behaviour. Those wishing to explore
	to depths of control ability should review the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> man page.
	</p><div class="variablelist"><p class="title"><b>File System Feature Comparison</b></p><dl><dt><span class="term">Name Space</span></dt><dd><p>
		MS Windows NT4 / 200x/ XP files names may be up to 254 characters long, Unix file names
		may be 1023 characters long. In MS Windows file extensions indicate particular file types,
		in Unix this is not so rigorously observed as all names are considered arbitrary. 
		</p><p>
		What MS Windows calls a Folder, Unix calls a directory,
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Case Sensitivity</span></dt><dd><p>
		MS Windows file names are generally Upper Case if made up of 8.3 (ie: 8 character file name
		and 3 character extension. If longer than 8.3 file names are Case Preserving, and Case
		Insensitive.
		</p><p>
		Unix file and directory names are Case Sensitive and Case Preserving. Samba implements the
		MS Windows file name behaviour, but it does so as a user application. The Unix file system
		provides no mechanism to perform case insensitive file name lookups. MS Windows does this
		by default. This means that Samba has to carry the processing overhead to provide features
		that are NOT native to the Unix operating system environment.
		</p><p>
		Consider the following, all are unique Unix names but one single MS Windows file name:
		<tt class="computeroutput">
				MYFILE.TXT
				MyFile.txt
				myfile.txt
		</tt>
		So clearly, In an MS Windows file name space these three files CAN NOT co-exist! But in Unix 
		they can. So what should Samba do if all three are present? Answer, the one that is lexically
		first will be accessible to MS Windows users, the others are invisible and unaccessible - any
		other solution would be suicidal.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Directory Separators</span></dt><dd><p>
		MS Windows and DOS uses the back-slash '\' as a directory delimiter, Unix uses the forward-slash '/'
		as it's directory delimiter. This is transparently handled by Samba.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Drive Identification</span></dt><dd><p>
		MS Windows products support a notion of drive letters, like <b class="command">C:</b> to represent
		disk partitions. Unix has NO concept if separate identifiers for file partitions since each
		such file system is <tt class="filename">mounted</tt> to become part of the over-all directory tree.
		The Unix directory tree begins at '/', just like the root of a DOS drive is specified like
		<b class="command">C:\</b>.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">File Naming Conventions</span></dt><dd><p>
		MS Windows generally never experiences file names that begin with a '.', while in Unix these
		are commonly found in a user's home directory. Files that begin with a '.' are typically
		either start up files for various Unix applications, or they may be files that contain
		start-up configuration data.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Links and Short-Cuts</span></dt><dd><p>
		MS Windows make use of &quot;links and Short-Cuts&quot; that are actually special types of files that will
		redirect an attempt to execute the file to the real location of the file. Unix knows of file and directory
		links, but they are entirely different from what MS Windows users are used to.
		</p><p>
		Symbolic links are files in Unix that contain the actual location of the data (file OR directory). An
		operation (like read or write) will operate directly on the file referenced. Symbolic links are also
		referred to as 'soft links'. A hard link is something that MS Windows is NOT familiar with. It allows
		one physical file to be known simultaneously by more than one file name.
		</p></dd></dl></div><p>
	There are many other subtle differences that may cause the MS Windows administrator some temporary discomfort
	in the process of becoming familiar with Unix/Linux. These are best left for a text that is dedicated to the
	purpose of Unix/Linux training/education.

	without having to resort to more complex facilities like POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Extended

	Additional possibilities in the [type] field are: c = character device, b = block device, p = pipe device, s = Unix Domain Socket.

	The letters `rwxXst' set permissions for the user, group and others as: read (r), write (w), execute (or access for directories) (x),
	execute  only  if  the  file  is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s),

	When the sticky bit is set on a directory, files in that directory may be unlinked (deleted) or renamed only by root or their owner. 
	Without the sticky  bit, anyone able to write to the directory can delete or rename files. The sticky bit is commonly found on
	directories, such as /tmp, that are world-writable.
	</p><p>
	When the set user or group ID bit (s) is set on a directory, then all files created within it will be owned by the user and/or

	</p><p>
	When a directory is set <tt class="constant">drw-r-----</tt> this means that the owner can read and create (write) files in it, but because
	the (x) execute flags are not set files can not be listed (seen) in the directory by anyone. The group can read files in the
	directory but can NOT create new files. NOTE: If files in the directory are set to be readable and writable for the group, then
	group members will be able to write to (or delete) them.

	This section deals with how to configure Samba per share access control restrictions.
	By default, Samba sets no restrictions on the share itself. Restrictions on the share itself
	can be set on MS Windows NT4/200x/XP shares. This can be a very effective way to limit who can
	connect to a share. In the absence of specific restrictions the default setting is to allow
	the global user <tt class="constant">Everyone</tt> Full Control (ie: Full control, Change and Read).
	</p><p>
	At this time Samba does NOT provide a tool for configuring access control setting on the Share
	itself. Samba does have the capacity to store and act on access control settings, but  the only
	way to create those settings is to use either the NT4 Server Manager or the Windows 200x MMC for
	Computer Management.
	</p><p>
	Samba stores the per share access control settings in a file called <tt class="filename">share_info.tdb</tt>.
	The location of this file on your system will depend on how samba was compiled. The default location
	for Samba's tdb files is under <tt class="filename">/usr/local/samba/var</tt>. If the <tt class="filename">tdbdump</tt>
	utility has been compiled and installed on your system, then you can examine the contents of this file
	by: <b class="userinput"><tt>tdbdump share_info.tdb</tt></b>.

			The tool you need to use to manage share permissions on a Samba server is the NT Server Manager.
			Server Manager is shipped with Windows NT4 Server products but not with Windows NT4 Workstation.
			You can obtain the NT Server Manager for MS Windows NT4 Workstation from Microsoft - see details below.

			On <span class="application">MS Windows NT4/200x/XP</span> system access control lists on the share itself are set using native

			MS Windows 200x and later all comes with a tool called the <span class="application">Computer Management</span> snap-in for the

			triplets are mapped by Samba into a three element NT ACL 
			with the 'r', 'w', and 'x' bits mapped into the corresponding 
			NT permissions. The UNIX world permissions are mapped into 
			the global NT group <tt class="constant">Everyone</tt>, followed 
			by the list of permissions allowed for UNIX world. The UNIX 
			owner and group permissions are displayed as an NT 
			<span class="guiicon">user</span> icon and an NT <span class="guiicon">local 
			group</span> icon respectively followed by the list 
			of permissions allowed for the UNIX user and group.</p><p>As many UNIX permission sets don't map into common 
			NT names such as <tt class="constant">read</tt>, <tt class="constant">
			&quot;change&quot;</tt> or <tt class="constant">full control</tt> then 
			usually the permissions will be prefixed by the words <tt class="constant">
			&quot;Special Access&quot;</tt> in the NT display list.</p><p>But what happens if the file has no permissions allowed 
			for a particular UNIX user group or world component ? In order 
			to  allow &quot;no permissions&quot; to be seen and modified then Samba 
			overloads the NT <b class="command">&quot;Take Ownership&quot;</b> ACL attribute 
			(which has no meaning in UNIX) and reports a component with 
			no permissions as having the NT <b class="command">&quot;O&quot;</b> bit set. 
			This was chosen of course to make it look like a zero, meaning 
			zero permissions. More details on the decision behind this will

			NT style. This first set of permissions is created by Samba in 
			exactly the same way as normal file permissions are, described 
			above, and is displayed in the same way.</p><p>The second set of directory permissions has no real meaning 
			in the UNIX permissions world and represents the <tt class="constant">
			inherited</tt> permissions that any file created within

		as changing the displayed permissions in the dialog box, and 
		clicking the <span class="guibutton">OK</span> button. However, there are 
		limitations that a user needs to be aware of, and also interactions 
		with the standard Samba permission masks and mapping of DOS 
		attributes that need to also be taken into account.</p><p>If the parameter <i class="parameter"><tt>nt acl support</tt></i>
		is set to <tt class="constant">false</tt> then any attempt to set 
		security permissions will fail with an <span class="errorname">&quot;Access Denied&quot;
		</span> message.</p><p>The first thing to note is that the <span class="guibutton">&quot;Add&quot;</span> 
		button will not return a list of users in Samba (it will give 
		an error message of <span class="errorname">The remote procedure call failed 
		and did not execute</span>). This means that you can only 
		manipulate the current user/group/world permissions listed in 
		the dialog box. This actually works quite well as these are the 
		only permissions that UNIX actually has.</p><p>If a permission triplet (either user, group, or world) 
		is removed from the list of permissions in the NT dialog box, 
		then when the <span class="guibutton">OK</span> button is pressed it will 
		be applied as &quot;no permissions&quot; on the UNIX side. If you then 
		view the permissions again the &quot;no permissions&quot; entry will appear 
		as the NT <b class="command">&quot;O&quot;</b> flag, as described above. This 
		allows you to add permissions back to a file or directory once 
		you have removed them from a triplet component.</p><p>As UNIX supports only the &quot;r&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and &quot;x&quot; bits of 
		an NT ACL then if other NT security attributes such as &quot;Delete 
		access&quot; are selected then they will be ignored when applied on 
		the Samba server.</p><p>When setting permissions on a directory the second 
		set of permissions (in the second set of parentheses) is 
		by default applied to all files within that directory. If this 
		is not what you want you must uncheck the <span class="guilabel">Replace 
		permissions on existing files</span> checkbox in the NT 
		dialog before clicking <span class="guibutton">OK</span>.</p><p>If you wish to remove all permissions from a 
		user/group/world  component then you may either highlight the 
		component and click the <span class="guibutton">Remove</span> button, 
		or set the component to only have the special <tt class="constant">Take

		</ns32:p><p>Once a user clicks <span class="guibutton">OK</span> to apply the

		the <i class="parameter"><tt>force directory mode</tt></i> parameter. </p><p>In this way Samba enforces the permission restrictions that 
		an administrator can set on a Samba share, whilst still allowing users 
		to modify the permission bits within that restriction.</p><p>If you want to set up a share that allows users full control

			Go to the top of the directory that is shared
			</p></li><li xmlns:ns33=""><ns33:p>
			Set the ownership to what ever public owner and group you want
			</ns33:p><pre class="programlisting">
			find 'directory_name' -type d -exec chown user.group {}\;
			find 'directory_name' -type d -exec chmod 6775 'directory_name'
			find 'directory_name' -type f -exec chmod 0775 {} \;
			find 'directory_name' -type f -exec chown user.group {}\;
			</pre><ns33:p>
			</ns33:p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
			The above will set the 'sticky bit' on all directories. Read your
			Unix/Linux man page on what that does. It causes the OS to assign 
			to all files created in the directories the ownership of the 
			directory.
			</p></div></li><li xmlns:ns34=""><ns34:p>

			Directory is: <i class="replaceable"><tt>/foodbar</tt></i>
			</ns34:p><pre class="screen">
				<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>chown jack.engr /foodbar</tt></b>
			</pre><ns34:p>
			</ns34:p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><ns34:p>
				</ns34:p><p>This is the same as doing:</p><ns34:p>
				</ns34:p><pre class="screen">
					<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>chown jack /foodbar</tt></b>
					<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>chgrp engr /foodbar</tt></b>
				</pre><ns34:p>
			</ns34:p></div></li><li xmlns:ns35=""><ns35:p>Now do: 

			</ns35:p><pre class="screen">
				<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>chmod 6775 /foodbar</tt></b>
				<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>ls -al /foodbar/..</tt></b>
			</pre><ns35:p>

			</ns35:p><ns35:p>You should see:
			</ns35:p><pre class="screen">
				drwsrwsr-x  2 jack  engr    48 2003-02-04 09:55 foodbar
			</pre><ns35:p>
			</ns35:p></li><li xmlns:ns36=""><ns36:p>Now do:

				<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>ls -al</tt></b>
			</pre><ns36:p>
		</ns36:p><ns36:p>
		You should see that the file <tt class="filename">Afile</tt> created by Jill will have ownership
		and permissions of Jack, as follows:
		</ns36:p><pre class="screen">
		-rw-r--r--  1 jack  engr     0 2003-02-04 09:57 Afile
		</pre><ns36:p>
		</ns36:p></li><li xmlns:ns37=""><ns37:p>
		Now in your <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> for the share add:
		</ns37:p><pre class="programlisting">
		force create mode = 0775
		force directory mode = 6775
		</pre><ns37:p>
		</ns37:p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
		The above are only needed <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> your users are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> members of the group
		you have used. ie: Within the OS do not have write permission on the directory.
		</p></div><ns37:p>
		An alternative is to set in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> entry for the share:
		</ns37:p><pre class="programlisting">
		force user = jack
		force group = engr
		</pre><ns37:p>
		</ns37:p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2924726"></a>I have set force user and Samba still makes <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span> the owner of all the files
