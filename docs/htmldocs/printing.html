There has been some initial confusion about what all this means
and whether or not it is a requirement for printer drivers to be 
installed on a Samba host in order to support printing from Windows 
clients. As a side note, Samba does not use these drivers in any way to process 
spooled files.  They are utilized entirely by the clients.

The following MS KB article, may be of some help if you are dealing with
Windows 2000 clients:  <span class="emphasis"><em>How to Add Printers with No User

Previous versions of Samba recommended using a share named [printer$].  
This name was taken from the printer$ service created by Windows 9x 
clients when a printer was shared.  Windows 9x printer servers always have 
a printer$ service which provides read-only access via no 
password in order to support printer driver downloads.
</p><p>
However, the initial implementation allowed for a 
parameter named <i><tt>printer driver location</tt></i> 
to be used on a per share basis to specify the location of 
the driver files associated with that printer.  Another 
parameter named <i><tt>printer driver</tt></i> provided 
a means of defining the printer driver name to be sent to 
the client.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2886557"></a>Creating [print$]</h3></div></div><p>
In order to support the uploading of printer driver 
files, you must first configure a file share named [print$].  
The name of this share is hard coded in Samba's internals so 
the name is very important (print$ is the service used by 
Windows NT print servers to provide support for printer driver 
download).
</p><p>You should modify the server's smb.conf file to add the global
parameters and to create the 
following file share (of course, some of the parameter values,
such as 'path' are arbitrary and should be replaced with
appropriate values for your site):</p><pre class="programlisting">
[global]
    ; members of the ntadmin group should be able
    ; to add drivers and set printer properties
    ; root is implicitly a 'printer admin'
    printer admin = @ntadmin

[print$]
    path = /usr/local/samba/printers
    guest ok = yes
    browseable = yes
    read only = yes
    ; since this share is configured as read only, then we need
    ; a 'write list'.  Check the file system permissions to make
    ; sure this account can copy files to the share.  If this
    ; is setup to a non-root account, then it should also exist
    ; as a 'printer admin'
    write list = @ntadmin,root
</pre><p>The <a href="smb.conf.5.html#WRITELIST" target="_top"><i><tt>
write list</tt></i></a> is used to allow administrative 
level user accounts to have write access in order to update files 
on the share.  See the <a href="smb.conf.5.html" target="_top">smb.conf(5) 
man page</a> for more information on configuring file shares.</p><p>The requirement for <a href="smb.conf.5.html#GUESTOK" target="_top"><b>guest 
ok = yes</b></a> depends upon how your
site is configured.  If users will be guaranteed to have 
an account on the Samba host, then this is a non-issue.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Author's Note</h3><p>
The non-issue is that if all your Windows NT users are guaranteed to be 
authenticated by the Samba server (such as a domain member server and the NT 
user has already been validated by the Domain Controller in 
order to logon to the Windows NT console), then guest access 
is not necessary.  Of course, in a workgroup environment where 
you just want to be able to print without worrying about 
silly accounts and security, then configure the share for 
guest access.  You'll probably want to add <a href="smb.conf.5.html#MAPTOGUEST" target="_top"><b>map to guest = Bad User
</b></a> in the [global] section as well.  Make sure 
you understand what this parameter does before using it 
though. --jerry
</p></div><p>In order for a Windows NT print server to support 
the downloading of driver files by multiple client architectures,
it must create subdirectories within the [print$] service
which correspond to each of the supported client architectures.
Samba follows this model as well.</p><p>Next create the directory tree below the [print$] share 
for each architecture you wish to support.</p><p><tt>
[print$]-----
        |-W32X86           ; &quot;Windows NT x86&quot;
        |-WIN40            ; &quot;Windows 95/98&quot;
        |-W32ALPHA         ; &quot;Windows NT Alpha_AXP&quot;
        |-W32MIPS          ; &quot;Windows NT R4000&quot;
        |-W32PPC           ; &quot;Windows NT PowerPC&quot;
</tt></p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">ATTENTION!  REQUIRED PERMISSIONS</h3><p>
In order to currently add a new driver to you Samba host, 
one of two conditions must hold true:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The account used to connect to the Samba host 
	must have a uid of 0 (i.e. a root account)</p></li><li><p>The account used to connect to the Samba host
	must be a member of the <a href="smb.conf.5.html#PRINTERADMIN" target="_top"><i><tt>printer 
	admin</tt></i></a> list.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of course, the connected account must still possess access
to add files to the subdirectories beneath [print$]. Remember
that all file shares are set to 'read only' by default.
</p></div><p>
Once you have created the required [print$] service and 
associated subdirectories, simply log onto the Samba server using 
a root (or <i><tt>printer admin</tt></i>) account
from a Windows NT 4.0/2k client.  Open &quot;Network Neighbourhood&quot; or
&quot;My Network Places&quot; and browse for the Samba host.  Once you have located
the server, navigate to the &quot;Printers...&quot; folder.
You should see an initial listing of printers
that matches the printer shares defined on your Samba host.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2886789"></a>Setting Drivers for Existing Printers</h3></div></div><p>The initial listing of printers in the Samba host's 
Printers folder will have no real printer driver assigned 
to them. This defaults to a NULL string to allow the use
of the local Add Printer Wizard on NT/2000 clients.
Attempting to view the printer properties for a printer
which has this default driver assigned will result in 
the error message:</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Device settings cannot be displayed.  The driver 
for the specified printer is not installed, only spooler 
properties will be displayed.  Do you want to install the 
driver now?</em></span>
</p><p>
Click &quot;No&quot; in the error dialog and you will be presented with
the printer properties window.  The way to assign a driver to a 
printer is to either
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use the &quot;New Driver...&quot; button to install 
	a new printer driver, or</p></li><li><p>Select a driver from the popup list of 
	installed drivers.  Initially this list will be empty.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you wish to install printer drivers for client 
operating systems other than &quot;Windows NT x86&quot;, you will need 
to use the &quot;Sharing&quot; tab of the printer properties dialog.</p><p>Assuming you have connected with a root account, you 
will also be able modify other printer properties such as 
ACLs and device settings using this dialog box.</p><p>A few closing comments for this section, it is possible 
on a Windows NT print server to have printers
listed in the Printers folder which are not shared.  Samba does
not make this distinction.  By definition, the only printers of
which Samba is aware are those which are specified as shares in
<tt>smb.conf</tt>.</p><p>Another interesting side note is that Windows NT clients do
not use the SMB printer share, but rather can print directly 
to any printer on another Windows NT host using MS-RPC.  This
of course assumes that the printing client has the necessary
privileges on the remote host serving the printer.  The default
permissions assigned by Windows NT to a printer gives the &quot;Print&quot;
permissions to the &quot;Everyone&quot; well-known group.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2886888"></a>Support a large number of printers</h3></div></div><p>One issue that has arisen during the development

In order to be able to use the APW to successfully add a printer to a Samba 
server, the <a href="smb.conf.5.html#ADDPRINTERCOMMAND" target="_top"><i><tt>add

<tt>smb.conf</tt> if necessary.
</p><p>
When using the APW from a client, if the named printer share does 
not exist, <b>smbd</b> will execute the <i><tt>add printer

to attempt to locate the new printer share.  If the share is still not defined,
an error of &quot;Access Denied&quot; is returned to the client.  Note that the

There is a complementary <a href="smb.conf.5.html#DELETEPRINTERCOMMAND" target="_top"><i><tt>delete

Windows NT/2000 print servers associate a port with each printer.  These normally
take the form of LPT1:, COM1:, FILE:, etc...  Samba must also support the
concept of ports associated with a printer.  By default, only one printer port,
named &quot;Samba Printer Port&quot;, exists on a system.  Samba does not really a port in
order to print, rather it is a requirement of Windows clients.  
</p><p>
Note that Samba does not support the concept of &quot;Printer Pooling&quot; internally 
either.  This is when a logical printer is assigned to multiple ports as 
a form of load balancing or fail over.
</p><p>
If you require that multiple ports be defined for some reason,
<tt>smb.conf</tt> possesses a <a href="smb.conf.5.html#ENUMPORTSCOMMAND" target="_top"><i><tt>enumports

		</tt></p><p>will reveal that Windows NT always uses the NT driver 
		name.  This is ok as Windows NT always requires that at least

		However, Samba does not have the requirement internally.  
		Therefore, how can you use the NT driver name if is has not 
		already been installed?</p><p>The way of sidestepping this limitation is to require

This is a short description of how to debug printing problems with
Samba. This describes how to debug problems with printing from a SMB
client to a Samba server, not the other way around. For the reverse
see the examples/printing directory.
</p><p>
Ok, so you want to print to a Samba server from your PC. The first
thing you need to understand is that Samba does not actually do any
printing itself, it just acts as a middleman between your PC client
and your Unix printing subsystem. Samba receives the file from the PC
then passes the file to a external &quot;print command&quot;. What print command
you use is up to you.
</p><p>
The whole things is controlled using options in smb.conf. The most
relevant options (which you should look up in the smb.conf man page)
are:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
      [global]
        print command     - send a file to a spooler
        lpq command       - get spool queue status
        lprm command      - remove a job
      [printers]
        path = /var/spool/lpd/samba
</pre><p>
The following are nice to know about:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
        queuepause command   - stop a printer or print queue
        queueresume command  - start a printer or print queue
</pre><p>
Example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
        print command = /usr/bin/lpr -r -P%p %s
        lpq command   = /usr/bin/lpq    -P%p %s
        lprm command  = /usr/bin/lprm   -P%p %j
        queuepause command = /usr/sbin/lpc -P%p stop
        queuepause command = /usr/sbin/lpc -P%p start
</pre><p>
Samba should set reasonable defaults for these depending on your
system type, but it isn't clairvoyant. It is not uncommon that you
have to tweak these for local conditions.  The commands should
always have fully specified pathnames,  as the smdb may not have
the correct PATH values.
</p><p>
When you send a job to Samba to be printed,  it will make a temporary
copy of it in the directory specified in the [printers] section.
and it should be periodically cleaned out.  The lpr -r option
requests that the temporary copy be removed after printing; If
printing fails then you might find leftover files in this directory,
and it should be periodically cleaned out.  Samba used the lpq
command to determine the &quot;job number&quot; assigned to your print job
by the spooler.
</p><p>
The %&gt;letter&lt; are &quot;macros&quot; that get dynamically replaced with appropriate
values when they are used. The %s gets replaced with the name of the spool
file that Samba creates and the %p gets replaced with the name of the
printer. The %j gets replaced with the &quot;job number&quot; which comes from
the lpq output.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2887448"></a>Debugging printer problems</h3></div></div><p>
One way to debug printing problems is to start by replacing these
command with shell scripts that record the arguments and the contents
of the print file. A simple example of this kind of things might
be:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
	print command = /tmp/saveprint %p %s

    #!/bin/saveprint
    # we make sure that we are the right user
    /usr/bin/id -p &gt;/tmp/tmp.print
    # we run the command and save the error messages
    # replace the command with the one appropriate for your system
    /usr/bin/lpr -r -P$1 $2 2&gt;&gt;&amp;/tmp/tmp.print
</pre><p>
Then you print a file and try removing it.  You may find that the
print queue needs to be stopped in order to see the queue status
and remove the job:
</p><pre class="programlisting">

h4: {42} % echo hi &gt;/tmp/hi
h4: {43} % smbclient //localhost/lw4
added interface ip=10.0.0.4 bcast=10.0.0.255 nmask=255.255.255.0
Password: 
Domain=[ASTART] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 2.0.7]
smb: \&gt; print /tmp/hi
putting file /tmp/hi as hi-17534 (0.0 kb/s) (average 0.0 kb/s)
smb: \&gt; queue
1049     3            hi-17534
smb: \&gt; cancel 1049
Error cancelling job 1049 : code 0
smb: \&gt; cancel 1049
Job 1049 cancelled
smb: \&gt; queue
smb: \&gt; exit
</pre><p>
The 'code 0' indicates that the job was removed.  The comment
by the  smbclient is a bit misleading on this.
You can observe the command output and then and look at the
/tmp/tmp.print file to see what the results are.  You can quickly
find out if the problem is with your printing system.  Often people
have problems with their /etc/printcap file or permissions on
various print queues.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2887515"></a>What printers do I have?</h3></div></div><p>
You can use the 'testprns' program to check to see if the printer
name you are using is recognized by Samba.  For example,  you can
use:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
    testprns printer /etc/printcap
</pre><p>
Samba can get its printcap information from a file or from a program.
You can try the following to see the format of the extracted
information:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
    testprns -a printer /etc/printcap

    testprns -a printer '|/bin/cat printcap'
</pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2887557"></a>Setting up printcap and print servers</h3></div></div><p>
You may need to set up some printcaps for your Samba system to use.
It is strongly recommended that you use the facilities provided by
the print spooler to set up queues and printcap information.
</p><p>
Samba requires either a printcap or program to deliver printcap
information.  This printcap information has the format:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
  name|alias1|alias2...:option=value:...
</pre><p>
For almost all printing systems, the printer 'name' must be composed
only of alphanumeric or underscore '_' characters.  Some systems also
allow hyphens ('-') as well.  An alias is an alternative name for the
printer,  and an alias with a space in it is used as a 'comment'
about the printer.  The printcap format optionally uses a \ at the end of lines
to extend the printcap to multiple lines.
</p><p>
Here are some examples of printcap files:
</p><p>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
pr              just printer name
</p></li><li><p>
pr|alias        printer name and alias
</p></li><li><p>
pr|My Printer   printer name, alias used as comment
</p></li><li><p>
pr:sh:\        Same as pr:sh:cm= testing
  :cm= \ 
  testing
</p></li><li><p>
pr:sh           Same as pr:sh:cm= testing
  :cm= testing
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><p>
Samba reads the printcap information when first started.  If you make
changes in the printcap information, then you must do the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
make sure that the print spooler is aware of these changes.
The LPRng system uses the 'lpc reread' command to do this.
</p></li><li><p>
make sure that the spool queues, etc., exist and have the
correct permissions.  The LPRng system uses the 'checkpc -f'
command to do this.
</p></li><li><p>
You now should send a SIGHUP signal to the smbd server to have
it reread the printcap information.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2887691"></a>Job sent, no output</h3></div></div><p>
This is the most frustrating part of printing.  You may have sent the
job,  verified that the job was forwarded,  set up a wrapper around
the command to send the file,  but there was no output from the printer.
</p><p>
First,  check to make sure that the job REALLY is getting to the
right print queue.  If you are using a BSD or LPRng print spooler,
you can temporarily stop the printing of jobs.  Jobs can still be
submitted, but they will not be printed.  Use:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
  lpc -Pprinter stop
</pre><p>
Now submit a print job and then use 'lpq -Pprinter' to see if the
job is in the print queue.  If it is not in the print queue then
you will have to find out why it is not being accepted for printing.
</p><p>
Next, you may want to check to see what the format of the job really
was.  With the assistance of the system administrator you can view
the submitted jobs files.  You may be surprised to find that these
are not in what you would expect to call a printable format.
You can use the UNIX 'file' utitily to determine what the job
format actually is:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
    cd /var/spool/lpd/printer   # spool directory of print jobs
    ls                          # find job files
    file dfA001myhost
</pre><p>
You should make sure that your printer supports this format OR that
your system administrator has installed a 'print filter' that will
convert the file to a format appropriate for your printer.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2888240"></a>Job sent, strange output</h3></div></div><p>
Once you have the job printing, you can then start worrying about
making it print nicely.
</p><p>
The most common problem is extra pages of output: banner pages
OR blank pages at the end.
</p><p>
If you are getting banner pages,  check and make sure that the
printcap option or printer option is configured for no banners.
If you have a printcap,  this is the :sh (suppress header or banner
page) option.  You should have the following in your printer.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
   printer: ... :sh
</pre><p>
If you have this option and are still getting banner pages,  there
is a strong chance that your printer is generating them for you
automatically.  You should make sure that banner printing is disabled
for the printer.  This usually requires using the printer setup software
or procedures supplied by the printer manufacturer.
</p><p>
If you get an extra page of output,  this could be due to problems
with your job format,  or if you are generating PostScript jobs,
incorrect setting on your printer driver on the MicroSoft client.
For example, under Win95 there is a option:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
  Printers|Printer Name|(Right Click)Properties|Postscript|Advanced|
</pre><p>
that allows you to choose if a Ctrl-D is appended to all jobs.
This is a very bad thing to do, as most spooling systems will
automatically add a ^D to the end of the job if it is detected as
PostScript.  The multiple ^D may cause an additional page of output.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2888316"></a>Raw PostScript printed</h3></div></div><p>
This is a problem that is usually caused by either the print spooling
system putting information at the start of the print job that makes
the printer think the job is a text file, or your printer simply
does not support PostScript.  You may need to enable 'Automatic
Format Detection' on your printer.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2888334"></a>Advanced Printing</h3></div></div><p>
Note that you can do some pretty magic things by using your
imagination with the &quot;print command&quot; option and some shell scripts.
Doing print accounting is easy by passing the %U option to a print
command shell script. You could even make the print command detect
the type of output and its size and send it to an appropriate
printer.

If the above debug tips don't help, then maybe you need to bring in
the bug guns, system tracing. See Tracing.txt in this directory.
