<title>Updating Samba-3</title>

<para>
It was a little difficult to select an appropriate title for this chapter.
From email messages on the Samba mailing lists it is clear that many people
consider the updating and upgrading of Samba to be a migration matter. Others
talk about migrating Samba servers when in fact the issue at hand is one of
installing a new Samba server to replace an older existing Samba server.
</para>

<para>
There has also been much talk about migration of Samba-3 from an smbpasswd
passdb backend to the use of the tdbsam or ldapsam facilities that are new
to Samba-3.
</para>

<para>
Clearly, there is not a great deal of clarity in the terminology that various
people apply to these modes by which Samba servers are updated. This is further 
highlighted by an email posting that included the following neat remark:
</para>

<blockquote><para>
I like the <quote>net rpc vampire</quote> on NT4, but that to my surpirse does
not seem to work against a Samba PDC and, if addressed in the Samba to Samba
context in either book, I could not find it.
</para></blockquote>

<para>
So in response to the significant request for these situations to be better 
documented this chapter has now been added. Your contributions and documentation
of real-world experiences will be a most welcome addition to this chapter.

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
A Windows network administrator explained in an email what changes he was
planning to make and and followed with the question: <quote>Anyone done this before?</quote>.
Many of us have upgraded and updated Samba without incident. Others have
experienced much pain and user frustration. So it is to be hoped that the
notes in this chapter will make a positive difference by assuring that
someone will be saved a lot of discomfort.
</para>

<para>
Before anyone commences an upgrade or an update of Samba the one cardinal
rule that must be observed is: Backup all Samba configuration files in
case it is necessary to revert to the old version. Even if you do not like
this precautionary step, users will punish an administrator who
fails to take adequate steps to avoid situations that may inflict lost
productivity on a user.

<title>Upgrading from Samba-2 to Samba-3</title>

<para>
Sites that are being upgraded from Samba-2 (or earlier versions) to Samba-3
may experience little difficulty or may require a lot of effort, depending
on the complexity of the configuration. Samba-1.9.x upgrades to Samba-3 will
generally be simple and straight forward, although no upgrade should be
attempted without proper planning and preparation.
