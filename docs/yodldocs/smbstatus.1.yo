The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell email(samba-bugs@samba.anu.edu.au). Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed.

The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page
sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software) and updated for the Samba2.0 release by Jeremy
Allison, email(samba-bugs@samba.anu.edu.au).

list of contributors and details on how to submit bug reports,
comments etc.
