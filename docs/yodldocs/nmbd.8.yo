manpagedescription()

This program is part of the bf(Samba) suite.

bf(nmbd) is a server that understands and can reply to NetBIOS over IP
name service requests, like those produced by SMBD/CIFS clients such
as Windows 95/98, Windows NT and LanManager clients. It also
participates in the browsing protocols which make up the Windows
"Network Neighborhood" view.

SMB/CIFS clients, when they start up, may wish to locate an SMB/CIFS
server. That is, they wish to know what IP number a specified host is
using.

Amongst other services, this program will listen for such requests,
and if its own NetBIOS name is specified it will respond with the IP
number of the host it is running on.  Its "own NetBIOS name" is by
default the primary DNS name of the host it is running on, but this
can be overriden with the bf(-n) option (see em(OPTIONS) below). Thus
nmbd will reply to broadcast queries for its own name(s). Additional
names for nmbd to respond on can be set via parameters in the
bf(smb.conf (5)) configuration file.

nmbd can also be used as a WINS (Windows Internet Name Server)
server. What this basically means is that it will act as a WINS
database server, creating a database from name registration requests
that it receives and replying to queries from clients for these names.

In addition, nmbd can act as a WINS proxy, relaying broadcast queries
from clients that do not understand how to talk the WINS protocol to a
WIN server.

manpageoptions()

startdit()

dit(bf(-D)) If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate
as a daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the background,
fielding requests on the appropriate port. By default, the server will
NOT operate as a daemon. nmbd can also be operated from the inetd
meta-daemon, although this is not recommended.

dit(bf(-a)) If this parameter is specified, each new connection will
append log messages to the log file.  This is the default.

dit(bf(-o)) If this parameter is specified, the log files will be
overwritten when opened.  By default, the log files will be appended
to.

dit(bf(-H filename)) NetBIOS lmhosts file.

The lmhosts file is a list of NetBIOS names to IP addresses that is
loaded by the nmbd server and used via the name resolution mechanism
em(name resolve order) described in bf(smbd.conf (5)) to resolve any
NetBIOS name queries needed by the server. Note that the contents of
this file are em(NOT) used by nmbd to answer any name queries, adding
a line to this file affects name NetBIOS resolution from this host
em(ONLY).

The default path to this file is compiled into Samba as part of the
build process. Common defaults are em(/usr/local/samba/lib/lmhosts),
em(/usr/samba/lib/lmhosts) or em(/etc/lmhosts). See the bf(lmhosts
(5)) man page for details on the contents of this file.

dit(bf(-d debuglevel)) debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10.

The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero.

The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files
about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors
and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day to day running - it generates a small amount of information about
operations carried out.

Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are
designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

dit(bf(-l logfile)) The bf(-l) parameter specifies a path and base
filename into which operational data from the running nmbd server will
be logged.  The actual log file name is generated by appending the
extension ".nmb" to the specified base name.  For example, if the name
specified was "log" then the file log.nmb would contain the debugging
data.

The default log file path is is compiled into Samba as part of the
build process. Common defaults are em(/usr/local/samba/var/log.nmb),
em(/usr/samba/var/log.nmb) or em(/var/log/log.nmb).

dit(bf(-n primary NetBIOS name)) This option allows you to override
the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical to
setting the bf(netbios name) parameter in the smb.conf file
but will override the setting in the smb.conf file.

dit(bf(-p UDP port number)) UDP port number is a positive integer value.

This option changes the default UDP port number (normally 137) that
nmbd responds to name queries on. Don't use this option unless you are
an expert, in which case you won't need help!

dit(bf(-s configuration file)) The default configuration file name is
set at build time, typically as em(/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf), but
this may be changed when Samba is autoconfigured.

The file specified contains the configuration details required by the
server.  See bf(smb.conf (5)) for more information.

dit(bf(-i scope)) This specifies a NetBIOS scope that the server will use
to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names. For details on the
use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes
are em(very) rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the
system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you
communicate with.

dit(bf(-h)) Prints the help information (usage) for nmbd.

endit()

manpagefiles()

bf(/etc/inetd.conf)

If the server is to be run by the inetd meta-daemon, this file must
contain suitable startup information for the meta-daemon.

bf(/etc/rc)

(or whatever initialisation script your system uses).

If running the server as a daemon at startup, this file will need to
contain an appropriate startup sequence for the server.

bf(/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf)

This is the default location of the em(smb.conf) server configuration
file. Other common places that systems install this file are
em(/usr/samba/lib/smb.conf) and em(/etc/smb.conf).

manpagesection(SIGNALS)

nmbd will accept SIGHUP, which will cause it to dump out it's
namelists into the file namelist.debug in the
em(/usr/local/samba/var/locks) directory (or the em(var/locks)
directory configured under wherever Samba was configured to install
itself). This will also cause nmbd to dump out it's server database in
the log.nmb file.  Also new in version 1.9.18 and above is the ability
to raise the debug log level of nmbd by sending it a SIGUSR1 (tt(kill
-USR1 <nmbd-pid>)) and to lower the nmbd log level by sending it a
SIGUSR2 (tt(kill -USR2 <nmbd-pid>)). This is to allow transient
problems to be diagnosed, whilst still running at a normally low log
level.

manpagesection(VERSION)

This man page is (mostly) correct for version 2.0 of the Samba suite,
plus some of the recent patches to it. These notes will necessarily
lag behind development of the software, so it is possible that your
version of the server has extensions or parameter semantics that
differ from or are not covered by this man page. Please notify these
to the address below for rectification.

bf(testparm (1)), bf(testprns (1)), and the Internet RFC's

manpageauthor()

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell (samba-bugs@samba.anu.edu.au). Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed.
