<title>Group Mapping &smbmdash; MS Windows and UNIX</title>


	<para>
<indexterm significance="preferred"><primary>groups</primary><secondary>mapping</secondary></indexterm>
	Starting with Samba-3, new group mapping functionality is available to create associations
	between Windows group SIDs and UNIX groups. The <command>groupmap</command> subcommand
	included with the &net; tool can be used to manage these associations.
	</para>

	<para>
	The new facility for mapping NT Groups to UNIX system groups allows the administrator to decide
	which NT Domain Groups are to be exposed to MS Windows clients. Only those NT Groups that map
	to a UNIX group that has a value other than the default (<constant>-1</constant>) will be exposed
	in group selection lists in tools that access domain users and groups.
	</para>

	<warning>
	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>domain admin group</primary></indexterm>
	The <parameter>domain admin group</parameter> parameter has been removed in Samba-3 and should no longer
	be specified in &smb.conf;. In Samba-2.2.x, this parameter was used to give the listed users membership in the
	<constant>Domain Admins</constant> Windows group which gave local admin rights on their workstations
	(in default configurations).
	</para>
	</warning>

<sect1>
<title>Features and Benefits</title>

	<para>
	Samba allows the administrator to create MS Windows NT4/200x group accounts and to
	arbitrarily associate them with UNIX/Linux group accounts.
	</para>

	<para>
<indexterm><primary>UID</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>GID</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>idmap uid</primary></indexterm>
	Group accounts can be managed using the MS Windows NT4 or MS Windows 200x/XP Professional MMC tools.
	Appropriate interface scripts should be provided in &smb.conf; if it is desired that UNIX/Linux system
	accounts should be automatically created when these tools are used. In the absence of these scripts, and
	so long as <command>winbindd</command> is running, Samba group accounts that are created using these
	tools will be allocated UNIX UIDs/GIDs from the ID range specified by the
	<smbconfoption name="idmap uid"/>/<smbconfoption name="idmap gid"/>
	parameters in the &smb.conf; file.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>groupadd</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>groupdel</primary></indexterm>
	Administrators should be aware that where &smb.conf; group interface scripts make
	direct calls to the UNIX/Linux system tools (the shadow utilities, <command>groupadd</command>,
	<command>groupdel</command>, and <command>groupmod</command>), the resulting UNIX/Linux group names will be subject
	to any limits imposed by these tools. If the tool does not allow upper case characters
	or space characters, then the creation of an MS Windows NT4/200x style group of
	<literal>Engineering Managers</literal> will attempt to create an identically named
	UNIX/Linux group, an attempt that will of course fail.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>GID</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>SID</primary></indexterm>
	There are several possible work-arounds for the operating system tools limitation. One
	method is to use a script that generates a name for the UNIX/Linux system group that
	fits the operating system limits, and that then just passes the UNIX/Linux group ID (GID)
	back to the calling Samba interface. This will provide a dynamic work-around solution.
	</para>

	<para>
	Another work-around is to manually create a UNIX/Linux group, then manually create the
	MS Windows NT4/200x group on the Samba server and then use the <command>net groupmap</command>
	tool to connect the two to each other.
	</para>

<title>Discussion</title>

	<para>
	When installing <application>MS Windows NT4/200x</application> on a computer, the installation
	program creates default users and groups, notably the <constant>Administrators</constant> group,
	and gives that group privileges necessary privileges to perform essential system tasks,
	such as the ability to change the date and time or to kill (or close) any process running on the
	local machine.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>Administrator</primary></indexterm>
	The <constant>Administrator</constant> user is a member of the <constant>Administrators</constant> group, and thus inherits
	<constant>Administrators</constant> group privileges. If a <constant>joe</constant> user is created to be a member of the
	<constant>Administrators</constant> group, <constant>joe</constant> has exactly the same rights as the user,
	<constant>Administrator</constant>.
	</para>

	<para>
	When an MS Windows NT4/200x/XP machine is made a Domain Member, the <quote>Domain Admins</quote> group of the
	PDC is added to the local <constant>Administrators</constant> group of the workstation. Every member of the
	<constant>Domain Administrators</constant> group inherits the rights of the local <constant>Administrators</constant> group when
	logging on the workstation.
	</para>

	<para>
	The following steps describe how to make Samba PDC users members of the <constant>Domain Admins</constant> group?
	</para>

	<orderedlist>
		<listitem><para>
		Create a UNIX group (usually in <filename>/etc/group</filename>), let's call it <constant>domadm</constant>.
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		Add to this group the users that must be <quote>Administrators</quote>. For example,
		if you want <constant>joe, john</constant> and <constant>mary</constant> to be administrators,
		your entry in <filename>/etc/group</filename> will look like this:
		</para>

		<para><programlisting>
		domadm:x:502:joe,john,mary
		</programlisting>
		</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>
		Map this domadm group to the <quote>Domain Admins</quote> group by running the command:
		</para>

		<para>
	<screen>
	&rootprompt;<userinput>net groupmap add ntgroup="Domain Admins" unixgroup=domadm</userinput>
	</screen>
	</para>
		
		<para>
		<indexterm><primary>Domain Admins group</primary></indexterm>
		The quotes around <quote>Domain Admins</quote> are necessary due to the space in the group name.
		Also make sure to leave no white-space surrounding the equal character (=).
		</para></listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<para>
	Now <constant>joe, john</constant> and <constant>mary</constant> are domain administrators.
	</para>

	<para>
	<indexterm><primary>groups</primary><secondary>domain</secondary></indexterm>
	It is possible to map any arbitrary UNIX group to any Windows NT4/200x group as well as
	making any UNIX group a Windows domain group. For example, if you wanted to include a
	UNIX group (e.g., acct) in an ACL on a local file or printer on a Domain Member machine,
	you would flag that group as a domain group by running the following on the Samba PDC:
	</para>

	<para>
<screen>
&rootprompt;<userinput>net groupmap add rid=1000 ntgroup="Accounting" unixgroup=acct</userinput>
</screen>
	</para>

	<para>
	Be aware that the RID parameter is a unsigned 32-bit integer that should
	normally start at 1000. However, this RID must not overlap with any RID assigned
	to a user. Verification for this is done differently depending on the passdb backend
	you are using. Future versions of the tools may perform the verification automatically,
	but for now the burden is on you.
	</para>

	<sect2>
	<title>Warning &smbmdash; User Private Group Problems</title>

	<para>
	Windows does not permit user and group accounts to have the same name.
	This has serious implications for all sites that use private group accounts.
	A private group account is an administrative practice whereby users are each
	given their own group account. Red Hat Linux, as well as several free distributions
	of Linux by default create private groups.
	</para>

	<para>
	When mapping a UNIX/Linux group to a Windows group account all conflict can
	be avoided by assuring that the Windows domain group name does not overlap
	with any user account name.
	</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2>
	<title>Nested Groups: Adding Windows Domain Groups to Windows Local Groups</title>

	<indexterm><primary>groups</primary><secondary>nested</secondary></indexterm>

	<para>
	This functionality is known as <constant>nested groups</constant> and was first added to
	Samba-3.0.3.
	</para>

	<para>
	All Microsoft Windows products since the release of Windows NT 3.10 support the use of nested groups.
	Many Windows network administrators depend on this capability becasue it greatly simplifies security
	administration.
	</para>

	<para>
	The nested group architecture was designed with the premise that day-to-day user and group membership
	management should be performed on the domain security database. The application of group security
	should be implemented on domain member servers using only local groups. On the domain member server
	all file system security controls are then limited to use of the local groups which will contain
	domain global groups and domain global users.
	</para>

	<para>
	You may ask, What are the benefits of this arrangement? The answer is obvious to those who have plumbed
	the dark depths of Windows networking architecture. Consider for a moment a server on which are stored
	200,000 files, each with individual domain user and domain group settings. The company that owns the
	file server is bought by another company resulting in the server being moved to another location and then
	it is made a member of a different domain. Who would you think now owns all the files and directories?
	Answer: Account Unknown.
	</para>

	<para>
	Unravelling the file ownership mess is an unenviable administrative task that can be avoided simply
	by using local groups to control all file and directory access control. In this case, only the members
	of the local groups will have been lost. The files and directories in the storage subsystem will still
	be owned by the local groups. The same goes for all ACLs on them. It is administratively much simpler
	to delete the <constant>Account Unknown</constant> membership entries inside local groups with appropriate
	entries for domain global groups in the new domain that the server has been made a member of.
	</para>

	<para>
	Another prominent example of the use of nested groups involves implementation of administrative privileges
	on domain member workstations and servers. Administrative privileges are given to all members of the
	builtin
	local group <constant>Administrators</constant> on each domain member machine. To ensure that all domain
	administrators have full rights on the member server or workstation, on joining the domain the
	<constant>Domain Admins</constant> group is added to the local Administrators group. Thus everyone who is
	logged into the domain as a member of the Domain Admins group is also granted local adminitrative
	privileges on each domain member.
	</para>

	<para>
	UNIX/Linux has no concept of support for nested groups, and thus Samba has for a long time not supported
	them either. The problem is that you would have to enter unix groups as auxiliary members of a group in
	<filename>/etc/group</filename>. This does not work because it was not a design requirement at the time
	the UNIX file system security model was implemented. Since Samba-2.2 the winbind daemon can provide
	<filename>/etc/group</filename> entries on demand by obtaining user and group information from the Domain
	Controller that the Samba server is a member of.
	</para>
	<para>
	In effect, Samba supplements the <filename>/etc/group</filename> data via the dynamic
	<command>libnss_winbind</command> mechanism. Beginning with Samba-3.0.3 this facility is used to provide
	local groups in the same manner as Windows does it. It works by expanding the local groups on the
	fly as they are accessed. For example, the <constant>Domain Users</constant> group of the domain is made
	a member of the local group <constant>demo</constant>. Whenever Samba needs to resolve membership of the
	<constant>demo</constant> local (alias) group winbind asks the DC for demo members of the Domain Users
	group. By definition it can only contain user objects which can then be faked to be member of the
	UNIX/Linux group <constant>demo</constant>.
	</para>

	<para>
	To enable the use of nested groups, <command>winbindd</command> must be used together with NSS winbind.
	Creation and administration of the local groups is done best via the Windows Domain User Manager or its
	Samba equivalent, the utility <command>net rpc group</command>. Creating the local group
	<constant>demo</constant> is achieved by executing:
	<screen>
	&rootprompt; net rpc group add demo -L -Uroot%not24get
	</screen>
	Here the -L switch means that you want to create a local group. It may be necessary to add -S and -U
	switches for accessing the correct host with appropriate user or root priviliges. Adding and removing
	group
	members can be done via the <constant>addmem</constant> and <constant>delmem</constant> subcommands of
	<command>net rpc group</command> command. For example addition of <quote>DOM\Domain Users</quote> to the
	local
	group <constant>demo</constant> would be done by executing:
	<screen>
	net rpc group addmem demo "DOM\Domain Users"
	</screen>
	Having completed these two steps the execution of <command>getent group demo</command> will show demo
	members of the global <constant>Domain Users</constant> group as members of  the group
	<constant>demo</constant>.  This also works with any local or domain user. In case the domain DOM trusts
	another domain, it is also possible to add global users and groups of the trusted domain as members of
	<constant>demo</constant>.
	</para>

	<title>Important Administrative Information</title>

	<para>
	Administrative rights are necessary in two specific forms:
	</para>

	<orderedlist>
		<listitem><para>For Samba-3 Domain Controllers and 
				Domain Member Servers/Clients.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>To manage Domain Member Windows workstations.</para></listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<para>
	Versions of Samba up to and including 3.0.10 do not provide a means for assigning rights and privileges
	that are necessary for system administration tasks from a Windows Domain Member Client machine so that
	domain administration tasks such as adding/deleting/changing user and group account information, and
	managing workstation domain membership accounts, can be handled by any account other than root.
	</para>

	<para>
	Samba-3.0.11 introduced a new privilege management interface (see <link linkend="rights">Chapter on Rights and Privileges</link>)
	that permits these tasks to be delegated to non-root (i.e.: accounts other than the equivalent of the
	MS Windows Administrator) account.
	</para>

	<para>
	Administrative tasks on a Windows Domain Member workstation, can be done by anyone who is a member of the
	<constant>Domain Admins</constant> group. This group can be mapped to any convenient UNIX group.
	</para>

	<sect3>
	<title>Applicable Only to Versions Earlier than 3.0.11</title>

	<para>
	Administrative tasks on UNIX/Linux systems, such as adding users or groups, requires <constant>root</constant>
	level privilege. The addition of a Windows client to a Samba Domain involves the addition of a user account
	for the Windows client.
	</para>

	<para>
	Many UNIX administrators continue to request the Samba Team make it possible to add Windows workstations, or 
	to ability to add/delete or modify user accounts, without requiring <constant>root</constant> privileges. 
	Such a request violates every understanding of basic UNIX system security.
	</para>

	<para>
	There is no safe way to provide access on a UNIX/Linux system without providing <constant>root</constant>
	level privilege. Provision of <constant>root</constant> privileges can be done either by logging onto
	the Domain as the user <constant>root</constant>, or by permitting particular users to use a UNIX account
	that has a UID=0 in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> database. Users of such accounts can use tools
	like the NT4 Domain User Manager, and the NT4 Domain Server Manager to manage user and group accounts as
	well as Domain Member server and client accounts. This level of privilege is also needed to manage share
	level ACLs.

	<title>Default Users, Groups and Relative Identifiers</title>

	<para>
<indexterm><primary>Relative Identifier</primary><see>RID</see></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>RID</primary></indexterm>
	When first installed, Microsoft Windows NT4/200x/XP are pre-configured with certain User, Group, and
	Alias entities. Each has a well-known Relative Identifier (RID). These must be preserved for continued
	integrity of operation. Samba must be provisioned with certain essential Domain Groups that require
	the appropriate RID value. When Samba-3 is configured to use <constant>tdbsam</constant> the essential
	Domain Groups are automatically created. It is the LDAP administrators' responsibility to create
	(provision) the default NT Groups.
	</para>

	<para>
	Each essential Domain Group must be assigned its respective well-known RID. The default Users, Groups,
	Aliases, and RIDs are shown in <link linkend="WKURIDS">Well-Known User Default RIDs</link> table.
	</para>

	<note><para>
	When the <parameter>passdb backend</parameter> uses LDAP (<constant>ldapsam</constant>) it is the
	administrators' responsibility to create the essential Domain Groups, and to assign each its default RID.
	</para></note>

	<para>
	It is permissible to create any Domain Group that may be necessary, just make certain that the essential
	Domain Groups (well known) have been created and assigned its default RID. Other groups you create may
	be assigned any arbitrary RID you care to use.
	</para>

	<para>
	Be sure to map each Domain Group to a UNIX system group. That is the only way to ensure that the group
	will be available for use as an NT Domain Group.

		It is a good idea to save this shell script for later re-use just in case you ever need to rebuild your mapping database.
		For the sake of convenience we elect to save this script as a file called <filename>initGroups.sh</filename>.
		This script is given in <link linkend="set-group-map">intGroups.sh</link>.

At this time there are many little surprises for the unwary administrator. In a real sense
it is imperative that every step of automated control scripts must be carefully tested
manually before putting them into active service.

	<title>Adding Groups Fails</title>

		<para>
		This is a common problem when the <command>groupadd</command> is called directly
		by the Samba interface script for the <smbconfoption name="add group script"/> in
		the &smb.conf; file.
		</para>

		<para>
		The most common cause of failure is an attempt to add an MS Windows group account
		that has either an upper case character and/or a space character in it.
		</para>

		<para>
		There are three possible work-arounds. First, use only group names that comply
		with the limitations of the UNIX/Linux <command>groupadd</command> system tool.
		Second, it involves the use of the script mentioned earlier in this chapter, and
		third is the option is to manually create a UNIX/Linux group account that can substitute
		for the MS Windows group name, then use the procedure listed above to map that group
		to the MS Windows group.

		The Power Users group is a group that is local to each Windows 200x/XP Professional workstation.
		You cannot add the Domain Users group to the Power Users group automatically, it must be done on
		each workstation by logging in as the local workstation <emphasis>administrator</emphasis> and
		then using the following procedure:
