.SH NAME
smbtree \- A text based smb network browser
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsmbtree\fR [ \fB-b\fR ] [ \fB-D\fR ] [ \fB-S\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite.
.PP
\fBsmbtree\fR is a smb browser program 
in text mode. It is similar to the "Network Neighborhood" found 
on Windows computers. It prints a tree with all 
the known domains, the servers in those domains and 
the shares on the servers.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-b\fR
Query network nodes by sending requests 
as broadcasts instead of querying the (domain) master browser.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Only print a list of all 
the domains known on broadcast or by the 
master browser
.TP
\fB-S\fR
Only print a list of 
all the domains and servers responding on broadcast or 
known by the master browser. 
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Prints the version number for 
\fBsmbd\fR.
.TP
\fB-s <configuration file>\fR
The file specified contains the 
configuration details required by the server.  The 
information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well 
as descriptions of all the services that the server is 
to provide. See \fIsmb.conf(5)\fR for more information.
The default configuration file name is determined at 
compile time.
.TP
\fB-d|--debug=debuglevel\fR
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer 
from 0 to 10.  The default value if this parameter is 
not specified is zero.

The higher this value, the more detail will be 
logged to the log files about the activities of the 
server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious 
warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day to day running - it generates a small amount of 
information about operations carried out.

Levels above 1 will generate considerable 
amounts of log data, and should only be used when 
investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for 
use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

Note that specifying this parameter here will 
override the log
level file.
.TP
\fB-l|--logfile=logbasename\fR
File name for log/debug files. The extension
".client" will be appended. The log file is
never removed by the client.
.TP
\fB-N\fR
If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal
password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when
accessing a service that does not require a password. 

Unless a password is specified on the command line or
this parameter is specified, the client will request a
password.
.TP
\fB-k\fR
Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only useful in
an Active Directory environment.
.TP
\fB-A|--authfile=filename\fR
This option allows
you to specify a file from which to read the username and
password used in the connection.  The format of the file is


.nf
username = <value>
password = <value>
domain   = <value>
.fi

Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict 
access from unwanted users. 
.TP
\fB-U|--user=username[%password]\fR
Sets the SMB username or username and password. 

If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted. The
client will first check the \fBUSER\fR environment variable, then the
\fBLOGNAME\fR variable and if either exists, the
string is uppercased. If these environmental variables are not
found, the username GUEST is used. 

A third option is to use a credentials file which
contains the plaintext of the username and password.  This
option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not
wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment
variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions
on the file restrict access from unwanted users.  See the
\fI-A\fR for more details. 

Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on
many systems the command line of a running process may be seen
via the \fBps\fR command.  To be safe always allow
\fBrpcclient\fR to prompt for a password and type
it in directly. 
.TP
\fB-h|--help\fR
Print a summary of command line options.
