.SH NAME
ntlm_auth \- tool to allow external access to Winbind's NTLM authentication function
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBntlm_auth\fR [ \fB-d debuglevel\fR ] [ \fB-l logfile\fR ] [ \fB-s <smb config file>\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite.
.PP
\fBntlm_auth\fR is a helper utility that authenticates 
users using NT/LM authentication. It returns 0 if the users is authenticated
successfully and 1 if access was denied. ntlm_auth uses winbind to access 
the user and authentication data for a domain. This utility 
is only to be used by other programs (currently squid).

\fBsmbd\fR.
.TP
\fB-s <configuration file>\fR
The file specified contains the 
configuration details required by the server.  The 
information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well 
as descriptions of all the services that the server is 
to provide. See \fIsmb.conf(5)\fR for more information.
The default configuration file name is determined at 
compile time.
.TP
\fB-d|--debug=debuglevel\fR
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer 
from 0 to 10.  The default value if this parameter is 
not specified is zero.

The higher this value, the more detail will be 
logged to the log files about the activities of the 
server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious 
warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day to day running - it generates a small amount of 
information about operations carried out.

Levels above 1 will generate considerable 
amounts of log data, and should only be used when 
investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for 
use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

Note that specifying this parameter here will 
override the log
level file.
.TP
\fB-l|--logfile=logbasename\fR
File name for log/debug files. The extension
".client" will be appended. The log file is
never removed by the client.
.TP
\fB-h|--help\fR
Print a summary of command line options.
