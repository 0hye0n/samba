.SH NAME
smbsh \- Allows access to Windows NT filesystem  using UNIX commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsmbsh\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fBsmbsh\fR allows you to access an NT filesystem 
using UNIX commands such as \fBls\fR, \fB egrep\fR, and \fBrcp\fR. You must use a 
shell that is dynamically linked in order for \fBsmbsh\fR 
to work correctly.
.PP
To use the \fBsmbsh\fR command, execute \fB smbsh\fR from the prompt and enter the username and password 
that authenticates you to the machine running the Windows NT 
operating system.
.PP
.sp
.nf
	system% \fBsmbsh\fR
	Username: \fBuser\fR
	Password: \fBXXXXXXX\fR
	
.sp
.fi
.PP
Any dynamically linked command you execute from 
this shell will access the \fI/smb\fR directory 
using the smb protocol. For example, the command \fBls /smb
\fRwill show a list of workgroups. The command 
\fBls /smb/MYGROUP \fR will show all the machines in 
the workgroup MYGROUP. The command 
\fBls /smb/MYGROUP/<machine-name>\fR will show the share 
names for that machine. You could then, for example, use the \fB cd\fR command to change directories, \fBvi\fR to 
edit files, and \fBrcp\fR to copy files.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
\fBsmbsh\fR works by intercepting the standard 
libc calls with the dynamically loaded versions in \fI smbwrapper.o\fR. Not all calls have been "wrapped", so 
some programs may not function correctly under \fBsmbsh
\fR\&.
.PP
Programs which are not dynamically linked cannot make 
use of \fBsmbsh\fR's functionality. Most versions 
of UNIX have a \fBfile\fR command that will 
describe how a program was linked.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBsmbd(8)\fR, 
smb.conf(5)
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
