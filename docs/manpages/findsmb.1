findsmb \- list info about machines that respond to SMB name queries on a subnet
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBfindsmb\fP [subnet broadcast address]
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This perl script is part of the \fBSamba\fP suite\&.
.PP 
\fBfindsmb\fP is a perl script that prints out several pieces
of information about machines on a subnet that respond to SMB 
name query requests\&.
It uses \fBnmblookup\fP and 
\fBsmbclient\fP to obtain this information\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "\fBsubnet broadcast address\fP" 
Without this option, \fBfindsmb\fP
will probe the subnet of the machine where \fBfindsmb\fP is run\&.
This value is passed to \fBnmblookup\fP as part of the \fB-B\fP
option
.IP 
.PP 
.SH "EXAMPLES" 
.PP 
The output of \fBfindsmb\fP lists the following information for all
machines that respond to the initial \fBnmblookup\fP for any name:
IP address, NetBIOS name, Workgroup name, operating system, and
SMB server version\&.
.PP 
There will be a "+" in front of the workgroup name for machines that are
local master browsers for that workgroup\&. There will be an "*" in front
of the workgroup name for machines that are the domain master browser for
that workgroup\&. Machines that are running Windows, Windows 95 or Windows 98
will not show any information about the operating system or server version\&.
.PP 
The command must be run on a system without 
\fBnmbd\fP running\&. If \fBnmbd\fP is running on the system, you will only 
get the IP address and the DNS name of the machine\&. To get proper responses 
from Windows 95 and Windows 98 machines, the command must be run as root\&. 
.PP 
For example running:
.PP 
\f(CWfindsmb\fP
.PP 
on a machine without \fBnmbd\fP running would yield output similar
to the following
