.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This program is part of the \fBSamba\fP suite\&.
.PP 
\fBsmbcontrol\fP is a very small program, which sends messages to an 
\fBsmbd\fP or an \fBnmbd\fP daemon 
running on the system\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "\fB-i\fP" 
Run interactively\&. Individual commands of the form
destination message-type parameters
can be entered on STDIN\&. An empty command line or a "q" will quit the program\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBdestination\fP" 
is one of "nmbd", "smbd" or a process ID\&.
.IP 
The \fBsmbd\fP destination causes the message to be "broadcast" to all
smbd daemons\&.
.IP 
The \fBnmbd\fP destination causes the message to be sent to the nmbd
daemon specified in the \fBnmbd\&.pid\fP file\&.
.IP 
If a single process ID is given, the message is sent to only that
process\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBmessage-type\fP" 
is one of: debug, force-election, ping, profile,
debuglevel, profilelevel, or printer-notify\&.
.IP 
The \fBdebug\fP message-type allows the debug level to be set to the value
specified by the parameter\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.
.IP 
The \fBforce-election\fP message-type can only be sent to the \fBnmbd\fP
destination\&. This message causes the \fBnmbd\fP daemon to force a
new browse master election\&.
.IP 
The \fBping\fP message-type sends the number of "ping" messages specified 
by the parameter and waits for the same number of 
reply "pong" messages\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.
.IP 
The \fBprofile\fP message-type sends a message to an smbd to change the profile
settings based on the parameter\&. The parameter can be "on" to turn on
profile stats collection, "off" to turn off profile stats collection, "count"
to enable only collection of count stats (time stats are disabled), and
"flush" to zero the current profile stats\&.
This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.
.IP 
The \fBdebuglevel\fP message-type sends a "request debug level" message\&.
The current debug level setting is returned by a 
"debuglevel" message\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.
.IP 
The \fBprofilelevel\fP message-type sends a "request profile level" message\&.
The current profile level setting is returned by a 
"profilelevel" message\&. This can be sent to any of the destinations\&.
.IP 
The \fBprinter-notify\fP message-type sends a message to smbd which in turn 
sends a printer notify message to any Windows NT clients connected to 
a printer\&.  This message-type takes an argument of the printer name to 
send notify messages to\&.   This message can only be sent to smbd\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBparameters\fP" 
is any parameters required for the message-type

.SH "AUTHOR" 
.PP 
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell \fIsamba@samba\&.org\fP\&. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP 
This man page source was written in YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at
\fBftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/\fP)
for the Samba 2\&.2\&.0 release by Herb Lewis\&.
\fIsamba@samba\&.org\fP\&.
