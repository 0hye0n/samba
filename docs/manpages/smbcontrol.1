The \fBsmbd\fP destination causes the message to be "broadcast" to all
smbd daemons\&.

The \fBnmbd\fP destination causes the message to be sent to the nmbd
daemon specified in the \fBnmbd\&.pid\fP file\&.
.IP 
If a single process ID is given, the message is sent to only that
process\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBmessage-type\fP"

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell \fIsamba@samba\&.org\fP\&. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed\&.
