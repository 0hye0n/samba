.SH NAME
smbstatus \- report on current Samba connections
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsmbstatus\fR [ \fB-P\fR ] [ \fB-b\fR ] [ \fB-d <debug level>\fR ] [ \fB-v\fR ] [ \fB-L\fR ] [ \fB-B\fR ] [ \fB-p\fR ] [ \fB-S\fR ] [ \fB-s <configuration file>\fR ] [ \fB-u <username>\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite.
.PP
\fBsmbstatus\fR is a very simple program to 
list the current Samba connections.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-P|--profile\fR
If samba has been compiled with the 
profiling option, print only the contents of the profiling 
shared memory area.
.TP
\fB-b|--brief\fR
gives brief output.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Prints the version number for 
\fBsmbd\fR.
.TP
\fB-s <configuration file>\fR
The file specified contains the 
configuration details required by the server.  The 
information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well 
as descriptions of all the services that the server is 
to provide. See \fIsmb.conf(5)\fR for more information.
The default configuration file name is determined at 
compile time.
.TP
\fB-d|--debug=debuglevel\fR
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer 
from 0 to 10.  The default value if this parameter is 
not specified is zero.

The higher this value, the more detail will be 
logged to the log files about the activities of the 
server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious 
warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day to day running - it generates a small amount of 
information about operations carried out.

Levels above 1 will generate considerable 
amounts of log data, and should only be used when 
investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for 
use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

Note that specifying this parameter here will 
override the log
level file.
.TP
\fB-l|--logfile=logbasename\fR
File name for log/debug files. The extension
".client" will be appended. The log file is
never removed by the client.
.TP
\fB-v|--verbose\fR
gives verbose output.
.TP
\fB-L|--locks\fR
causes smbstatus to only list locks.
.TP
\fB-B|--byterange\fR
causes smbstatus to include byte range locks.
.TP
\fB-p|--processes\fR
print a list of \fBsmbd\fR(8) processes and exit. 
Useful for scripting.
.TP
\fB-S|--shares\fR
causes smbstatus to only list shares.
.TP
\fB-h|--help\fR
Print a summary of command line options.
.TP
\fB-u|--user=<username>\fR
selects information relevant to 
\fIusername\fR only.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 3.0 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBsmbd\fR(8) and \fBsmb.conf\fR(5).
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at  ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison.  The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2
for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
