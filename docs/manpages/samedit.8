.SH "NAME" 
samedit \- Security Access Manager editor
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.YODLTAGSTART. roffcmd .IP "\fBsamedit\fP [-d debuglevel] [-S server] [-l logbasename] [-n netbios name] [-N]
[-m maxprotocol] [-I destIP] [-E] [-U username] [-W workgroup] [-c `command string`]
[-t terminalcode] [-i scope] [-O socket options]
[-s smb\&.conf]" .YODLTAGEND. 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
used for editing the Security Access Manager (SAM) database\&. The SAM
database is the portion of the NT registry that holds the user and
machine account information and passwords\&. Samedit can also do a number of
tests and queries on the SAM database\&.
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
.IP "\fB-d debuglevel\fP" 
set the debuglevel\&. Debug level 0 is the lowest and 100 being the
highest\&. This should be set to 100 if you are planning on 
submitting a bug report to the Samba team (see BUGS\&.txt)\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-S server\fP" 
NetBIOS name of Server to connect to (\e\e\&. or \&.
for localhost)\&. The server can be any SMB/CIFS server\&. The name is resolved
using either the "name resolve order = " line or by using the
\fB-R\fP option\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-l logbasename\fP" 
File name for log/debug files\&. \&.client will be
appended\&. The log file is never removed  by the client\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-n netbios name\fP" 
NetBIOS name of the local machine\&. This option
is only needed if your Samba client cannot find
it automatically\&. Samba should use the uppercase of the machine\'s
hostname\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-N\fP" 
tells samedit not to ask for a password\&. samedit will prompt
the user by default\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-m max protocol\fP" 
is ignored in Samba TNG\&. It is included only for backwards compatibility\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-I destIP\fP" 
The IP address of the server specified with the \fB-S\fP
option\&. Only needed when the server\'s NetBIOS
name cannot be resolved using WINS or broadcast
and isn\'t found in the LMHOSTS file\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-E\fP" 
causes regedit to write messages to stderr instead of stdout\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-U username[%pass]\fP" 
Sets the SMB username or username and password\&. If %pass is not
specified, The user will be prompted\&. The client will first check the USER
environment variable, then the LOGNAME variable and if either exist, the
string is uppercased\&. Anything in these variables following a % sign will be
treated as the password\&. If these environmental variables are not found, the
username GUEST is used\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-W domain\fP" 
Set the SMB domain\&. Note that this is very different
from the DNS domain name\&. For information on NT domains,
consult
\fBLars Kneschke\'s Samba TNG FAQ\fP at if(http://www\&.kneschke\&.de/projekte/samba_tng/)\&.
This overrides the default domain which is the domain of the server specified
with the bt(-S) option\&. If the domain specified is the same as the server\'s NetBIOS
name, it causes the client to log on using the server\'s local SAM (as opposed to the
Domain SAM)\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-c \'command string\'\fP" 
execute semicolon separated commands (listed below))
.PP 
.IP "\fB-t terminalcode\fP" 
This tells the Samba client how to interpret the incoming filenames, in regards
to character sets\&. The list here is not complete\&. For a complete list see your
local Samba source\&. Some valid options are sjis, euc, jis7, jis8, junet and hex\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-O socket options\fP" 
These socket options are the same as in smb\&.conf (under the bt(socket options = )
section)\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-s smb\&.conf\fP" 
Specifies the location of the all important smb\&.conf file\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-i scope\fP" 
Defines the NetBIOS scope\&. For more information on NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001
and rfc1002\&. NetBIOS scopes are rarely used\&.

.SH "BUGS" 
Samba TNG is still in alpha stage and considered not suitable for production use\&.
.PP 
From Luke Leighton\'s original rpcclient man page:
"WARNING! The MSRPC over SMB code has been developed from examining Network traces\&. No documentation is available from the original creators (Microsoft) on how MSRPC over SMB works, or how the individual MSRPC services work\&. Microsoft\'s implementation of these services has been demonstrated (and reported) to be\&.\&.\&. a bit flakey in places\&.
.PP 
The development of Samba\'s implementation is also a bit rough, and as more of the services are understood, it can even result in versions of \fBsmbd(8)\fP and rpcclient that are incompatible for some commands or services\&. Additionally, the developers are sending reports to Microsoft, and problems found or reported to Microsoft are fixed in Service Packs, which may result in incompatabilities\&."

.SH "AUTHOR" 
Samba is written by The Samba Team as open source\&. This man page was written by Matthew Geddes and has strongly "borrowed" from Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton\'s original rpcclient man page and wise words and the Samba source\&.
