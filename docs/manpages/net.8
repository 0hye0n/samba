.SH NAME
net \- Tool for administration of Samba and remote CIFS servers.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBnet\fR \fB<ads|rap|rpc>\fR [ \fB-h\fR ] [ \fB-w workgroup\fR ] [ \fB-W myworkgroup\fR ] [ \fB-U user\fR ] [ \fB-I ip-address\fR ] [ \fB-p port\fR ] [ \fB-n myname\fR ] [ \fB-s conffile\fR ] [ \fB-S server\fR ] [ \fB-l\fR ] [ \fB-P\fR ] [ \fB-D debuglevel\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite.
.PP
The samba net utility is meant to work just like the net utility 
available for windows and DOS. The first argument should be used 
to specify the protocol to use when executing a certain command. 
ADS is used for ActiveDirectory, RAP is using for old (Win9x/NT3) 
clients and RPC can be used for NT4 and Windows 2000. If this 
argument is omitted, net will try to determine it automatically. 
Not all commands are available on all protocols.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-h|--help\fR
Print a summary of command line options.
.TP
\fB-w target-workgroup\fR
Sets target workgroup or domain. You have to specify 
either this option or the IP address or the name of a server.
.TP
\fB-W workgroup\fR
Sets client workgroup or domain
.TP
\fB-U user\fR
User name to use
.TP
\fB-I ip-address\fR
IP address of target server to use. You have to
specify either this option or a target workgroup or
a target server.
.TP
\fB-p port\fR
Port on the target server to connect to (usually 139 or 445). 
Defaults to trying 445 first, then 139.
.TP
\fB-n <primary NetBIOS name>\fR
This option allows you to override
the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical
to setting the \fINetBIOS
name\fR parameter in the \fBsmb.conf\fR(5) file.  However, a command
line setting will take precedence over settings in
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5).
.TP
\fB-s <configuration file>\fR
The file specified contains the 
configuration details required by the server.  The 
information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well 
as descriptions of all the services that the server is 
to provide. See \fIsmb.conf(5)\fR for more information.
The default configuration file name is determined at 
compile time.
.TP
\fB-S server\fR
Name of target server. You should specify either 
this option or a target workgroup or a target IP address.
.TP
\fB-l\fR
When listing data, give more information on each item.
.TP
\fB-P\fR
Make queries to the external server using the machine account of the local server.
.TP
\fB-d|--debug=debuglevel\fR
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer 
from 0 to 10.  The default value if this parameter is 
not specified is zero.

The higher this value, the more detail will be 
logged to the log files about the activities of the 
server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious 
warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day to day running - it generates a small amount of 
information about operations carried out.

Levels above 1 will generate considerable 
amounts of log data, and should only be used when 
investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for 
use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

Note that specifying this parameter here will 
override the log
level file.
