Upgrading from an older samba4 installation.

For users of samba4 alpha 8 and after
=====================================

* Stop any samba process
* Backup your samba4 provision:
  go in the directory where your samba4 provision is stored (/usr/local/samba by default)
  do tar cf $HOME/backup.tar private (it's also recommended to save the etc/smb.conf and var/sysvol dir aswell)
* Go in the source4 dir
* run ./scripting/bin/upgradeprovision
* do make install
