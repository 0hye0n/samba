                  WHATS NEW IN Samba 3.0 alpha24
                          14th May 2003
                  ==============================

This is a pre-release of Samba 3.0. This is NOT a stable release.
Use at your own risk. 

The purpose of this alpha release is to get wider testing of the major
new pieces of code in the current Samba 3.0 development tree. We have
officially ceased development on the 2.2.x release of Samba and are
concentrating on Samba 3.0. To reduce the time before the final Samba 3.0
release we need as many people as possible to start testing these alpha
releases, and hopefully giving us some high quality feedback on what needs
fixing.

Note that Samba 3.0 is not feature complete yet. There is a more
coding we have planned, but unless we get what we have done already more
widely tested we will have a hard time doing a stable release in a
reasonable time frame.

Major new features:
-------------------

- Active Directory support. This release is able to join a ADS realm
  as a member server and authenticate users using LDAP/kerberos.

- Unicode support. Samba will now negotiate UNICODE on the wire and
  internally there is now a much better infrastructure for multi-byte
  and UNICODE character sets.

- New authentication system. The internal authentication system has
  been almost completely rewritten. Most of the changes are internal,
  but the new auth system is also very configurable.

- new filename mangling system. The filename mangling system has been
  completely rewritten. An internal database now stores mangling maps
  persistently. This needs lots of testing.

- new "net" command. A new "net" command has been added. It is
  somewhat similar to the "net" command in windows. Eventually we plan
  to replace a bunch of other utilities (such as smbpasswd) with
  subcommands in "net", at the moment only a few things are
  implemented.

- Samba now negotiates NT-style status32 codes on the wire. This
  improves error handling a lot.

- better w2k printing support including publishing printer
  attributes in active directory

- new loadable RPC modules

- new dual-daemon winbindd support for better performance

- support for migrating from a Windows NT 4.0 domain

- support for establishing trust relationships with Windows NT 4.0
  domain controllers

Plus lots of other changes!


Reporting bugs & Development Discussion
---------------------------------------

Please discuss this release on the samba-technical mailing list or by
joining the #samba-technical IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.

If you do report problems then please try to send high quality
feedback. If you don't provide vital information to help us track down
the problem then you will probably be ignored.


Changes in alpha23:
-------------------

  LDAP Schema Changes
  -------------------
  A new objectclass (sambaSamAccount) has been introduced to replace the old
  sambaAccount.  This change aids us in the renaming of attributes to prevent
  clashes with attributes from other vendors.  There is a conversion script
  (examples/LDAP/convertSambaAccount) to modify and LDIF file to the new schema.
  
  Example:
  
  	$ ldapsearch .... -b "ou=people,dc=..." > old.ldif
	$ convertSambaAccount <DOM SID> old.ldif new.ldif
	
  The <DOM SID> can be obtained by running 'net getlocalsid <DOMAINNAME>' 
  on the Samba PDC as root.
  
  The sambaDomain and sambaGroupMapping objects have also been modified
  to use the new attribute naming conventions as well.  There are no 
  conversion scripts for this data since the old schema was never published 
  in a stable release.
  
  The old sambaAccount schema may still be used by specifying the 
  "ldapsam_compat" passdb backend.
  
  Parameters
  ----------

  Removed Parameters

  * total print jobs

  Known Issues
  ------------
  
  The following are known issues with this release and will be corrected
  in future versions:
  
  1) Automatically generating accounts for users and groups from 
     trusted domains when Samba is acting as a PDC
  2) Maintaining idmap ID's in a LDAP directory in order to implement 
     a distributed winbind solution
