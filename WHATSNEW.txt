Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first preview release of Samba 4.10.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.10 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

GPO Improvements
----------------

A new 'samba-tool gpo export' command has been added that can export a
set of Group Policy Objects from a domain in a generalised XML format.

A corresponding 'samba-tool gpo restore' command has been added to
rebuild the Group Policy Objects from the XML after generalization.
(The administrator needs to correct the values of XML entities between
the backup and restore to account for the change in domain).

kdc prefork
-----------

The KDC now supports the pre-fork process model and worker processes will be
forked for the KDC when the pre-fork process model is selected for samba.

prefork 'prefork children'
--------------------------

The default value for this smdb.conf parameter has been increased from 1 to
4.

netlogon prefork
----------------

DCERPC now supports pre-forked NETLOGON processes. The netlogon processes are
pre-forked when the prefork process model is selected for samba.

Offline domain backups
----------------------

The 'samba-tool domain backup' command has been extended with a new 'offline'
option. This safely creates a backup of the local DC's database directly from
disk. The main benefits of an offline backup are it's quicker, it stores more
database details (for forensic purposes), and the samba process does not have
to be running when the backup is made. Refer to the samba-tool help for more
details on using this command.

Group membership statistics
---------------------------

A new 'samba-tool group stats' command has been added. This provides summary
information about how the users are spread across groups in your domain.
The 'samba-tool group list --verbose' command has also been updated to include
the number of users in each group.

prefork process restart
-----------------------

The pre-fork process model now restarts failed processes. The delay between
restart attempts is controlled by the "prefork backoff increment" (default = 10)
and "prefork maximum backoff" (default = 120) smbd.conf parameters.  A linear
back off strategy is used with "prefork backoff increment" added to the
delay between restart attempts up until it reaches "prefork maximum backoff".

Using the default sequence the restart delays (in seconds) are:
  0, 10, 20, ..., 120, 120, ...

standard process model
----------------------

When using the standard process model samba forks a new process to handle ldap
and netlogon connections.  Samba now honours the 'max smbd processes' smb.conf
parameter.  The default value of 0, indicates there is no limit.  The limit
is applied individually to netlogon and ldap.  When the process limit is
exceeded Samba drops new connections immediately.

python3 support
---------------

The version of python which is now the default for samba is python3.
'configure' & 'make' will execute using python3. It is possible to still
specify an additional python version with '--extra-python'
e.g. '--extra-python=/usr/bin/python2'. It should be noted that support for
this option will be deprecated in a future release.

What if I need to build with python2? To build with python2 you *must* set
the 'PYTHON' environent variable to override the python3 default for both
'configure' and 'make' steps.

   'PYTHON=python2 ./configure.developer'
&
   'PYTHON=python2 make'

Note: Support for python2 (with the exception of a build configured with
      'PYTHON=python2 ./configure --disable-python' and built with
      'PYTHON=python2 make' will be deprecated in the next release.

JSON logging
------------

Authentication messages now contain the Windows Event Id "eventId" and logon
type "logonType". The supported event codes and logon types are:
  Event codes:
    4624  Successful logon
    4625  Unsuccessful logon

  Logon Types:
    2  Interactive
    3  Network
    8  NetworkCleartext

The version number for Authentication messages is now 1.1, changed from 1.0

Password change messages now contain the Windows Event Id "eventId", the
supported event Id's are:
  4723 Password changed
  4724 Password reset

The version number for PasswordChange messages is now 1.1, changed from 1.0

Group membership change messages now contain the Windows Event Id "eventId",
the supported event Id's are:
  4728 A member was added to a security enabled global group
  4729 A member was removed from a security enabled global group
  4732 A member was added to a security enabled local group
  4733 A member was removed from a security enabled local group
  4746 A member was added to a security disabled local group
  4747 A member was removed from a security disabled local group
  4751 A member was added to a security disabled global group
  4752 A member was removed from a security disabled global group
  4756 A member was added to a security enabled universal group
  4757 A member was removed from a security enabled universal group
  4761 A member was added to a security disabled universal group
  4762 A member was removed from a security disabled universal group


The version number for GroupChange messages is now 1.1, changed from 1.0. Also
A GroupChange message is generated when a new user is created to log that the
user has been added to their primary group.

The leading "JSON <message type>:" and source file  prefix of the JSON formatted
log entries has been removed to make the parsing of the JSON log messages
easier. JSON log entries now start with 2 spaces followed by an opening brace
i.e. "  {"




REMOVED FEATURES
================

MIT Kerberos build of the AD DC
-------------------------------

While not removed, the MIT Kerberos build of the Samba AD DC is still
considered experimental.  Because Samba will not issue security
patches for this configuration, such builds now require the explicit
configure option: --with-experimental-mit-ad-dc

For further details see
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Running_a_Samba_AD_DC_with_MIT_Kerberos_KDC

samba_backup
------------

The samba_backup script has been removed. This has now been replaced by the
'samba-tool domain backup offline' command.
