              WHATS NEW IN 1.9.17alpha1 - May 21st 1997.
              ==========================================

Improved browsing support. 
--------------------------

Samba now should support propagation of browse lists 
across subnets correctly. Look in the file docs/BROWSING.txt 
as it has been largely re-written to explain how to do this.

Thanks to Silicon Graphics for allowing us to test the new 
code on their corporate network.

Improved share mode handling
----------------------------

The handling of share modes has been completely rewritten.
Samba can now run agressive PC Benchmarks (Ziff-Davis
NetBench) correctly with many hundreds of concurrent PC's.
The confidence level on share mode handling in Samba
is now much higher than it was previously. PC database
packages should be much safer when run against a
Samba share. Thanks to Silicon Graphics for testing
this code for us.

If at all possible compile Samba to use the new share
mode handling with shared memory (set the flags 
FAST_SHARE_MODES in the Makefile). This will be *much* faster
than old file-based share modes. FAST_SHARE_MODES have
been turned on by default on the following platforms in
the Makefile :

	Linux
	Solaris
	BSDI
	IRIX 5.x.x
	FreeBSD

Updated smb.conf documentation
------------------------------

All options are now documented we believe.

Many small bugfixes and improvements
------------------------------------
From around the 'net around the world. Many
thanks to everyone who contributed.

Remember - this is new code so there may be
bugs or problems.

As always, all bugs are our responsibility - 
please report them to :

samba-bugs@samba.anu.edu.au


Regards,

	The Samba Team.
