What's new in Samba 4 alpha20
=============================

Samba 4.0 will be the next version of the Samba suite and incorporates
all the technology found in both the Samba4 alpha series and the
stable 3.x series. The primary additional features over Samba 3.6 are
support for the Active Directory logon protocols used by Windows 2000
and above.

SECURITY RELEASE
================

This is a security release in order to address CVE-2012-2111
(Incorrect permission checks when granting/removing privileges can
compromise file server security).

o  CVE-2012-2111:
   Samba 3.4.x to 3.6.4 are affected by a
   vulnerability that allows arbitrary users
   to modify privileges on a file server.

This is in regards to the smbd file server, which is shipped in Samba
4.0 alpha.  The AD DC is not directly impacted, as the LSA
implementation differs.

WARNINGS
========

Samba4 alpha20 is not a final Samba release, however we are now making
good progress towards a Samba 4.0 release, of which this is a preview.
Be aware the this release contains both the technology of Samba 3.6
(that you can reasonably expect to upgrade existing Samba 3.x releases
to) and the AD domain controller work previously known as 'samba4'.

While binaries for the stable file server are provided in this
release, for a stable, supported file server, Samba3 domain or AD
domain member installation, please run a Samba 3.x release, as we are
still bedding down the new single build system.

Samba4 is subjected to an awesome battery of tests on an automated
basis, we have found Samba 4.0 to be very stable in it's behavior.
However, we still recommend against upgrading production servers from
Samba 3.x release to Samba 4.0 alpha at this stage.

If you are upgrading, or looking to develop, test or deploy Samba 4.0
alpha releases, you should backup all configuration and data.

NEW FEATURES
============

Samba 4.0 alpha supports the server-side of the Active Directory logon
environment used by Windows 2000 and later, so we can do full domain
join and domain logon operations with these clients.

Our Domain Controller (DC) implementation includes our own built-in
LDAP server and Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) as well as the
Samba3-like logon services provided over CIFS.  We correctly generate
the infamous Kerberos PAC, and include it with the Kerberos tickets we
issue.

Samba 4.0 alpha ships with two distinct file servers.  The file server
from the Samba 3.x series is 'smbd', and works with the binaries users
would expect from that series (nmbd, winbindd, smbpasswd).

Samba 4.0 also ships with a new file server, which is tuned to match
the requirements of an AD domain controller.  Users should not use the
file server in the 'samba' binary for non-DC related tasks.

A new scripting interface has been added to Samba 4, allowing Python
programs to interface to Samba's internals, and many tools and
internal workings of the DC code is now implemented in python.


CHANGES SINCE alpha19
=====================

For a list of changes since alpha 19, please see the git log.

$ git clone git://git.samba.org/samba.git
$ cd samba.git
$ git log samba-4.0.0alpha19..samba-4.0.0alpha20

Some major user-visible changes include:

Improvements to the 'samba-tool domain samba3upgrade' and
samba_upgradedns tools

Stability improvements in the Samba4 winbind implementation (that
used in the AD DC mode).

The BIND 9 DLZ plugin is now compatible with both BIND 9.8, and BIND 9.9.

dbcheck and runtime protection for the fSMORoleOwner attribute.  This
allows us to recover from a situation where the fSMORoleOwner is
deleted.

Support for storing the posixAccount and other auxiliary objectClass
values (the values are not used by Samba as an AD DC at this stage,
but may be used by clients).


Some major but less visible changes include:

Continued early implementation work on the SMB 2.2 protocol client and server as
the team improves and develops support these new protocols.

Initial work to build Samba using MIT kerberos in the top level waf
build system.  This is not complete at this time, but good progress is
being made.


KNOWN ISSUES
============

- upgradeprovision should not be run when upgrading to this release
  from a recent release.  No important database format changes have
  been made since alpha16.  

- Installation on systems without a system iconv (and developer
  headers at compile time) is known to cause errors when dealing with
  non-ASCII characters.

- In some situations, group members may not be upgraded by the
  samba-tool domain samba3upgrade tool

- Domain member support in the 'samba' binary is in it's infancy, and
  is not comparable to the support found in winbindd.  As such, do not
  use the 'samba' binary (provided for the AD server) on a member
  server.

- There is no printing support in the 'samba' binary (use smbd instead)

- There is no NetBIOS browsing support (network neighbourhood) in the
  'samba' binary (use nmbd and smbd instead)

- Clock Synchronisation is critical.  Many 'wrong password' errors are
  actually due to Kerberos objecting to a clock skew between client
  and server.  (The NTP work in the previous alphas are partly to assist
  with this problem).

- The DRS replication code may fail.  Please contact the team if you
  experience issues with DRS replication, as we have fixed many issues
  here in response to feedback from our production users.
