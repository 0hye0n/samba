                  WHATS NEW IN Samba 3.0.0 beta1
                           June 7 2003
                  ==============================

This is a beta of Samba 3.0. This is a non-production release intended 
for testing purposes.  Use at your own risk. 

The purpose of this beta release is to get wider testing of the major
new pieces of code in the current Samba 3.0 development tree. We have
officially ceased development on the 2.2.x release of Samba and are
concentrating on Samba 3.0. To reduce the time before the final 
Samba 3.0 release we need as many people as possible to start testing 
these beta releases, and hopefully giving us some high quality feedback 
on what needs fixing.

Samba 3.0 is feature complete yet. However there is still some final 
work to be done on certain pieces of functionality.  Please refer to 
the section on "Known Issues" for more details.


Major new features:
-------------------

1)  Active Directory support. This release is able to join a ADS realm
    as a member server and authenticate users using LDAP/kerberos.

2)  Unicode support. Samba will now negotiate UNICODE on the wire and
    internally there is now a much better infrastructure for multi-byte
    and UNICODE character sets.

3)  New authentication system. The internal authentication system has
    been almost completely rewritten. Most of the changes are internal,
    but the new auth system is also very configurable.

4)  New filename mangling system. The filename mangling system has been
    completely rewritten. An internal database now stores mangling maps
    persistently. This needs lots of testing.

5)  New "net" command. A new "net" command has been added. It is
    somewhat similar to the "net" command in windows. Eventually we 
    plan to replace a bunch of other utilities (such as smbpasswd) 
    with subcommands in "net", at the moment only a few things are
    implemented.

6)  Samba now negotiates NT-style status32 codes on the wire. This
    improves error handling a lot.

7)  Better Windows 2000/XP/2003 printing support including publishing 
    printer attributes in active directory

8)  New loadable RPC modules

9)  New dual-daemon winbindd support (-B) for better performance

10) Support for migrating from a Windows NT 4.0 domain to a Samba 
    domain and maintaining user, group and domain SIDs

11) Support for establishing trust relationships with Windows NT 4.0
    domain controllers
  
12) Initial support for a distributed winbind architecture using
    an LDAP directory for storing SID to uid/gid mappings
  
13) Major updates to the Samba documentation tree.

Plus lots of other improvements!


Additional Documentation
------------------------

Please refer to Samba documentation tree (including in the docs/ 
subdirectory) for extensive explanations of installing, configuring
and maintaining Samba 3.0 servers and clients.  It is advised to 
begin with the Samba-HOWTO-Collection for overviews and specific 
tasks (the current book is up to approximately 400 pages) and to 
refer to the various man pages for information on individual options.

Databases
---------

This section contains brief descriptions of any new databases 
introduced in Samba 3.0.  Please remember to backup your existing 
${lock directory}/*tdb before upgrading to Samba 3.0.  Samba will 
upgrade databases as they are opened (if necessary), but downgrading 
from 3.0 to 2.2 is an unsupported path.

Name		Description				Backup?
----		-----------				-------
account_policy	User policy settings			yes
gencache	Generic caching db			no
group_mapping	Mapping table from Windows		yes
		groups/SID to unix groups	
idmap		new ID map table from SIDS		yes
		to UNIX uids/gids.
namecache	Name resolution cache entries		no
netlogon_unigrp	Cache of universal group 		no
		membership obtained when 
		operating as a member of a 
		Windows domain
printing/*.tdb	Cached output from 'lpq 		no
		command' created on a per print 
		service basis
registry	Read-only samba registry skeleton	no
		that provides support for exporting
		various db tables via the winreg RPCs


Changes in Behavior
-------------------

The following issues are known changes in bahavior between Samba 2.2 and 
Samba 3.0 that may affect certain installations of Samba.

  1)  When operating as a member of a Windows domain, Samba 2.2 would 
      map any users authenticated by the remote DC to the 'guest account'
      if a uid could not be obtained via the getpwnam() call.  Samba 3.0
      rejects the connection as NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE.  There is no 
      current work around to re-establish the 2.2 behavior.
      
  2)  When adding machines to a Samba 2.2 controlled domain, the 
      'add user script' was used to create the UNIX identity of the 
      machine trust account.  Samba 3.0 introduces a new 'add machine 
      script' that must be specified for this purpose.  Samba 3.0 will
      not fall back to using the 'add user script' in the absence of 
      an 'add machine script'
  

######################################################################
Passdb Backends and Authentication
##################################

There have been a few new changes that Samba administrators should be
aware of when moving to Samba 3.0.

  1) encrypted passwords have been enabled by default in order to 
     interoperate better with out-of-the-box Windows client 
     installations.  This does mean that either (a) a samba account
     must be created for each user, or (b) 'encrypt passwords = no'
     must be explicitly defined in smb.conf.
    
  2) Inclusion of new 'security = ads' option for integration 
     with an Active Directory domain using the native Windows
     Kerberos 5 and LDAP protocols.

Samba 3.0 also includes the possibility of setting up chains
of authentication methods (auth methods) and account storage 
backends (passdb backend).  Pleas erefer to the smb.conf(5) 
man page for details.  While both parameters assume sane default 
values, it is likely that you will need to understand what the 
values actually mean in order to ensure Samba operates correctly.

The recommended passdb backends at this time are

  * smbpasswd - 2.2 comatible flat file format
  * tdbsam - attribute rich database intended as an smbpasswd
    replacement for stand alone servers
  * ldapsam - attribute rich account storage and retrieval 
    backend utilizing an LDAP directory.  
  * ldapsam_compat - a 2.2 backwards compatible LDAP account 
    backend
    
Certain functions of the smbpasswd(8) tool have been split between the 
new smbpasswd(8) utility, the net(8) tool, and the new pdbedit(8) 
utility.
    
     
######################################################################
LDAP
####

This section outlines the new features affecting Samba / LDAP integration.

  New Schema
  ----------
  
  A new objectclass (sambaSamAccount) has been introduced to replace 
  the old sambaAccount.  This change aids us in the renaming of attributes 
  to prevent clashes with attributes from other vendors.  There is a 
  conversion script (examples/LDAP/convertSambaAccount) to modify and LDIF 
  file to the new schema.
  
  Example:
  
  	$ ldapsearch .... -b "ou=people,dc=..." > old.ldif
	$ convertSambaAccount <DOM SID> old.ldif new.ldif
	
  The <DOM SID> can be obtained by running 'net getlocalsid <DOMAINNAME>' 
  on the Samba PDC as root.
  
  The sambaDomain and sambaGroupMapping objects have also been modified
  to use the new attribute naming conventions as well.  There are no 
  conversion scripts for this data since the old schema was never published 
  in a stable release.
  
  The old sambaAccount schema may still be used by specifying the 
  "ldapsam_compat" passdb backend.
  

######################################################################
Known Issues
############

One such limitation that is worth mentioning (and will be corrected 
before the actual stable 3.0.0 release is the dead lock problem with
running winbindd on a Samba PDC in order to allocate uids and gids for 
users and groups in a trusted domain.  When the Samba domain is acting 
as the trusted domain to a Windows NT 4.0 domain, there are no known 
issues.

Please refer to https://bugzilla.samba.org/ for a current list of bugs 
filed against the Samba 3.0 codebase.
