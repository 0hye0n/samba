              WHATS NEW IN Samba 2.2.0alpha0
              ==============================

This is the first alpha release of the new 2.2.0 codebase
for Samba. This version must not be run in production.

This code will almost certainly have some bugs and is
intended to help the Samba Team prepare an official 2.2.0
release.

The documentation in this alpha snapshot is not up to date,
there are many new parameters since 2.0.7. This will be
corrected in a later alpha release.

The upcoming 2.2.0 Samba release will include the following
new features: 

Support for native Windows NT4/2000 printing RPCs.
This includes support for automatic printer driver
download. 

Rewritten internal locking semantics for more robustness.
This alpha supports full 64 bit locking semantics on all
(even 32 bit) platforms. SMB locks are mapped onto POSIX
locks (32 bit or 64 bit) as the underlying system allows.

Conversion of various internal flat data structures to use
database records for increased performance and
flexibility. 

Support for acting as a MS-DFS server 

Compile time option for enabling a VFS layer 

Support for server supported Access Control Lists (ACLs).
This support will require a specific pluggable backend to
be written for each filesystem ACL implementation to be
supported. The stable 2.2.0 release should contain
support for the following filesystems: 
    Solaris 2.6+ 
    HPUX
    SGI Irix 
    Linux Kernel 2.2 with German ACL patch 

Currently in this alpha snapshot (alpha0) this feature
is not enabled - the VFS layer has been modified to allow
it, but the code is still under development and should
be in a later alpha snapshot.

Other platforms will be supported as resources are
available to test and implement the encessary modules. If
you are interested in writing the support for a particular
ACL filesystem, please join the samba-technical mailing
list and coordinate your efforts.
