              WHATS NEW IN Samba 2.2.0
              ========================

This is the official Samba 2.2.0 release. This version of Samba provides
the following new features and enhancements.

Integration between Windows oplocks and NFS file opens (IRIX and Linux
2.4 kernel only). This gives complete data and locking integrity between
Windows and UNIX file access to the same data files.

Ability to act as an authentication source for Windows 2000 clients as
well as for NT4.x clients.

Integration with the winbind daemon that provides a single
sign on facility for UNIX servers in Windows 2000/NT4 networks
driven by a Windows 2000/NT4 PDC. winbind is not included in
this release, it currently must be obtained separately. We are
committed to including winbind in a future Samba 2.2.x release.

Support for native Windows 2000/NT4 printing RPCs. This includes
support for automatic printer driver download.

Support for server supported Access Control Lists (ACLs).
This release contains support for the following filesystems: 

    Solaris 2.6+ 
    SGI Irix 
    Linux Kernel with ACL patch from http://acl.bestbits.at
	Linux Kernel with XFS ACL support.
	Caldera/SCO UnixWare
	IBM AIX
	FreeBSD (with external patch)

Other platforms will be supported as resources are
available to test and implement the encessary modules. If
you are interested in writing the support for a particular
ACL filesystem, please join the samba-technical mailing
list and coordinate your efforts. 
 
On PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) based systems - better debugging
messages and encrypted password users now have access control verified via
PAM - Note: Authentication still uses the encrypted password database.
 
Rewritten internal locking semantics for more robustness.
This release supports full 64 bit locking semantics on all
(even 32 bit) platforms. SMB locks are mapped onto POSIX
locks (32 bit or 64 bit) as the underlying system allows.

Conversion of various internal flat data structures to use
database records for increased performance and
flexibility. 

Support for acting as a MS-DFS (Distributed File System) server.

Support for manipulating Samba shares using Windows client tools
(server manager). Per share security can be set using these tools
and Samba will obey the access restrictions applied.

Samba profiling support (see below).

Compile time option for enabling a (Virtual file system) VFS layer 
to allow non-disk resources to be exported as Windows filesystems
(such as databases etc.).

The documentation in this release has been updated and converted
from Yodl to DocBook 4.1. There are many new parameters since 2.0.7
and some defaults have changed.

Profiling support.
------------------
Support for collection of profile information. A shared 
memory area has been created which contains counters for
the number of calls to and the amount of time spent in
various system calls and smb transactions. See the file
profile.h for a complete listing of the information 
collected. Sample code for a samba pmda (collection agent
for Performance Co-Pilot) has been included in the pcp
directory. 

To enable the profile data collection code in samba, you 
must compile samba with profile support (run configure with 
the --with-profile option). On startup, collection of data
is disabled. To begin collecting data use the smbcontrol
program to turn on profiling (see the smbcontrol man page).
Profile information collection can be enabled for all smbd
processes or one or more selected processes. The profiling
data collected is the aggragate for all processes that have
profiling enabled.

With samba compiled for profile data collection, you may see
a very slight degradation in performance even with profiling
collection turned off. On initial tests with NetBench on an
SGI Origin 200 server, this degradation was not measureable 
with profile collection off compared to no profile collection
compiled into samba. 

With count profile collection enabled on all clients, the 
degradation was less than 2%. With full profile collection 
enabled on all clients, the degradation was about 8.5%.
