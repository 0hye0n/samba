Release Announcements
=====================

This is the third release candidate of Samba 4.6.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.6 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========

vfs_fruit option "fruit:resource" spelling correction
-----------------------------------------------------

Due to a spelling error in the vfs_fruit option parsing for the "fruit:resource"
option, users who have set this option in their smb.conf were still using the
default setting "fruit:resource = file" as the parser was looking for the string
"fruit:ressource" (two "s").

After upgrading to this Samba version 4.6, you MUST either remove the option
from your smb.conf or set it to the default "fruit:resource = file", otherwise
your macOS clients will not be able to access the resource fork data.

This version Samba 4.6 accepts both the correct and incorrect spelling, but the
next Samba version 4.7 will not accept the wrong spelling.

Users who were using the wrong spelling "ressource" with two "s" can keep the
setting, but are advised to switch to the correct spelling.

ID Mapping
----------
We discovered that the majority of users have an invalid or incorrect
ID mapping configuration. We implemented checks in the 'testparm' tool to
validate the ID mapping configuration. You should run it and check if it prints
any warnings or errors after upgrading! If it does you should fix them. See the
'IDENTITY MAPPING CONSIDERATIONS' section in the smb.conf manpage.
There are some ID mapping backends which are not allowed to be used for the
default backend. Winbind will no longer start if an invalid backend is
configured as the default backend.

To avoid problems in future we advise all users to run 'testparm' after
changing the smb.conf file!

vfs_fruit Netatalk metadata xattr name on *BSD
----------------------------------------------

Users on *BSD must rename the metadata xattr used by vfs_fruit when
using the default setting "fruit:metadata = netatalk".

Due to a glitch in the Samba xattr API compatibility layer for FreeBSD and a
mistake in vfs_fruit, vfs_fruit ended up using the wrong xattr name when
configured with "fruit:metadata = netatalk" (default). Instead of the correct

  org.netatalk.Metadata

it used

  netatalk.Metadata

Starting with Samba 4.6 vfs_fruit will use the correct "org.netatalk.Metadata"
which means existing installations must rename this xattrs. For this purpose
Samba now includes a new tool `mvxattr`. See below for further details.


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Kerberos client encryption types
--------------------------------
Some parts of Samba (most notably winbindd) perform Kerberos client
operations based on a Samba-generated krb5.conf file. A new
parameter, "kerberos encryption types" allows configuring the
encryption types set in this file, thereby allowing the user to
enforce strong or legacy encryption in Kerberos exchanges.

The default value of "all" is compatible with previous behavior, allowing
all encryption algorithms to be negotiated. Setting the parameter to "strong"
only allows AES-based algorithms to be negotiated. Setting the parameter to
"legacy" allows only RC4-HMAC-MD5 - the legacy algorithm for Active Directory.
This can solves some corner cases of mixed environments with Server 2003R2 and
newer DCs.

Printing
--------
Support for uploading printer drivers from newer Windows clients (Windows 10)
has been added until our implementation of [MS-PAR] protocol is ready.
Several issues with uploading different printing drivers have been addressed.

The OS Version for the printing server has been increased to announce
Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2. If a driver needs a newer version then you should
check the smb.conf manpage for details.

new option for owner inheritance
--------------------------------
The "inherit owner" smb.conf parameter instructs smbd to set the
owner of files to be the same as the parent directory's owner.
Up until now, this parameter could be set to "yes" or "no".
A new option, "unix only", enables this feature only for the UNIX owner
of the file, not affecting the SID owner in the Windows NT ACL of the
file. This can be used to emulate something very similar to folder quotas.

Multi-process Netlogon support
------------------------------

The Netlogon server in the Samba AD DC can now run as multiple
processes.  The Netlogon server is a part of the AD DC that handles
NTLM authentication on behalf of domain members, including file
servers, NTLM-authenticated web servers and 802.1x gateways.  The
previous restriction to running as a single process has been removed,
and it will now run in the same process model as the rest of the
'samba' binary.

As part of this change, the NETLOGON service will now run on a distinct
TCP port, rather than being shared with all other RPC services (LSA,
SAMR, DRSUAPI etc).

new options for controlling TCP ports used for RPC services
-----------------------------------------------------------

The new 'rpc server port' option controls the default port used for
RPC services other than Netlogon.  The Netlogon server honours instead
the 'rpc server port:netlogon' option.  The default value for both
these options is the first available port including or after 1024.

AD LDAP and replication performance improvements
------------------------------------------------

Samba's LDB (the database holding the AD directory tree, as seen via
LDAP) and our DRSUAPI replication code continues to improve,
particularly in respect to the handling of large numbers of objects or
linked attributes.

 * We now respect an 'uptodateness vector' which will dramatically
   reduce the over-replication of links from new DCs.

 * We have also made the parsing of on-disk linked attributes much
   more efficient.

 * We rely on ldb 1.1.28.  This ldb version has improved memory
   handling for ldb search results, improving poorly indexed and
   unindexed search result processing speed by around 20%.

DNS improvements
----------------

The samba-tool dns subcommand is now much more robust and can delete
records in a number of situations where it was not possible to do so
in the past.

On the server side, DNS names are now more strictly validated.

CTDB changes
------------

* "ctdb event" is a new top-level command for interacting with event scripts

  "ctdb event status" replaces "ctdb scriptstatus" - the latter is
  maintained for backward compatibility but the output format has been
  cleaned up

  "ctdb event run" replaces "ctdb eventscript"

  "ctdb event script enable" replaces "ctdb enablescript"

  "ctdb event script disable" replaces "ctdb disablescript"

  The new command "ctdb event script list" lists event scripts.

* CTDB's back-end for running event scripts has been replaced by a
  separate, long-running daemon ctdbd_eventd.

* Running ctdb interactively will log to stderr

* CTDB logs now include process id for each process

* CTDB tags log messages differently.  Changes include:

  ctdb-recoverd: Messages from CTDB's recovery daemon
  ctdb-recovery: Messages from CTDB database recovery
  ctdb-eventd: Messages from CTDB's event daemon
  ctdb-takeover: Messages from CTDB's public IP takeover subsystem

* The mapping between symbolic and numeric debug levels has changed

  Configurations containing numeric debug levels should be updated.
  Symbolic debug levels are recommended.  See the DEBUG LEVEL section
  of ctdb(7) for details.

*  Tunable IPAllocAlgorithm replaces LCP2PublicIPs, DeterministicIPs

   See ctdb-tunables(7) for details

* CTDB's configuration tunables should be consistently set across a cluster

  This has always been the cases for most tunables but this fact is
  now documented.

* CTDB ships with recovery lock helper call-outs for etcd and Ceph RADOS

  To build/install these, use the --enable-etcd-reclock and
  --enable-ceph-reclock configure options.

winbind changes
---------------

4.6 winbind simplifies the calculation of supplementary groups to make
it more reliable and predictable. Before 4.6, winbind contained code
that tried to emulate the group membership calculation that domain
controllers do when a user logs in. This group membership calculation
is a very complex process, in particular for domain trust relationship
situations. Also, in many scenarios it is impossible for winbind to
correctly do this calculation due to access restrictions in the
domains: winbind using its machine account simply does not have the
rights to ask for an arbitrary user's group memberships.

When a user logs in to a Samba server, the domain controller correctly
calculates the user's group memberships authoritatively and makes the
information available to the Samba server. This is the only reliable
way Samba can get informed about the groups a user is member of.

Because of its flakiness, the fallback group membership code was
removed.

This means that "id <username>" without the user having logged in
previously stops showing any supplementary groups. Also, it will show
"DOMAIN\Domain Users" as the primary group. Once the user has logged
in, "id <username>" will correctly show the primary group and
supplementary group list.

winbind primary group and nss info
----------------------------------

With 4.6, it will be possible to optionally use the primary group as
set in the "Unix Attributes" tab for the local unix token of a domain
user.  Before 4.6, the Windows primary group was always chosen as
primary group for the local unix token.

To activate the unix primary group, set

idmap config <DOMAIN> : unix_primary_group = yes

Similarly, set

idmap config <DOMAIN> : unix_nss_info = yes

to retrieve the home directory and login shell from the "Unix
Attributes" of the user. This supersedes the "winbind nss info"
parameter with a per-domain configuration option.

mvxattr
-------

mvxattr is a simple utility to recursively rename extended attributes of all
files and directories in a directory tree.

  Usage: mvxattr -s STRING -d STRING PATH [PATH ...]
    -s, --from=STRING         xattr source name
    -d, --to=STRING           xattr destination name
    -l, --follow-symlinks     follow symlinks, the default is to ignore them
    -p, --print               print files where the xattr got renamed
    -v, --verbose             print files as they are checked
    -f, --force               force overwriting of destination xattr

  Help options:
    -?, --help                Show this help message
    --usage                   Display brief usage message
