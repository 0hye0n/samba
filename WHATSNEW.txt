UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

kerberos client encryption types
--------------------------------
Some parts of Samba (most notably winbindd) perform Kerberos client
operations based on a Samba-generated krb5.conf file. A new
parameter, "kerberos encryption types" allows configuring the
encryption types set in this file, thereby allowing the user to
enforce strong or legacy encryption in Kerberos exchanges.

The default value of "all" is compatible with previous behavior, allowing
all encryption algorithms to be negotiated. Setting the parameter to "strong"
only allows AES-based algorithms to be negotiated. Setting the parameter to
"legacy" allows only RC4-HMAC-MD5 - the legacy algorithm for Active Directory.
This can solves some corner cases of mixed environments with Server 2003R2 and
newer DCs.
