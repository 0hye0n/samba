                   Release Notes for Samba 3.4.0pre1

                   =================================

This is the first preview release of Samba 3.4.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Major enhancements in Samba 3.4.0 include:

Authentication Changes:
o Changed the way smbd handles untrusted domain names given during user
  authentication

net Command Changes:
o parameter syntax made more consistent

Authentication Changes
======================

Previously, when Samba was a domain member and a client was connecting using an
untrusted domain name, such as BOGUS\user smbd would remap the untrusted
domain to the primary domain smbd was a member of and attempt authentication
using that DOMAIN\user name.  This differed from how a Windows member server
would behave.  Now, smbd will replace the BOGUS name with it's SAM name.  In
the case where smbd is acting as a PDC this will be DOMAIN\user.  In the case
where smbd is acting as a domain member server this will be WORKSTATION\user.
Thus, smbd will never assume that an incoming user name which is not qualified
with the same primary domain, is part of smbd's primary domain.

While this behavior matches Windows, it may break some workflows which depended
on smbd to always pass through bogus names to the DC for verification.  A new
parameter "map untrusted to domain" can be enabled to revert to the legacy
behavior.

net Command Changes
===================

The net command now accepts the common command line parameters most other Samba
command line utilities use, with a couple of remaining differences:

-l still gives long output for net commands supporting the --long flag. This was
more useful than the common --log-base parameter.

-i still tells net to read data from stdin (like --stdin) instead of toggling
the common --scope flag.

-S still tells net the server to connect to (like --server) instead of
negotiating the common --signing flag. As -S is probably used by most scripts
doing net rpc commands, this would have been a high-impact change for little
gain.

This change was mainly done to unify the authentification options. Here, one
flag changed it's meaning and one useful flag was added.

-N used to be the short version of --ntname. It now matches the Samba default of
--no-pass. Use this to stop net from prompting for a password if you want
anonymous authentication.

-A --authentication-file now takes an authentication file with the username and
password you want net to use, avoiding a password prompt as with plain -U user
or having to give a password on the command line as in -U user%pass.

Last but not least net now always falls back to your local unix username if no
-U is specified and a username is needed. net rpc commands will now prompt for a
password unless one is specified using either -U user%pass or -A auth_file.
