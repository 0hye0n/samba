          WHATS NEW IN 2.0.0 ALPHA SERIES
          ===============================

This is an alpha release of Samba. Releases in this series are done
automatically every week based on the latest code in the Samba CVS
tree. 

THIS RELEASE IS NOT PRODUCTION QUALITY. IT MAY NOT EVEN COMPILE. 

If you use this release then be aware of the following:

- only use these releases if you can't use CVS for some
  reason. Getting the code via anonymous cvs is preferable. See
  http://samba.anu.edu.au/cvs.html 

- don't use this code if you are not an experienced programmer. We are
  doing these releases so that users who cannot access the CVS tree
  directly for some reason can report/fix bugs. If you find bugs in
  this release and you want to help fix them then please join the
  samba-technical mailing list (see http://samba.anu.edu.au/listproc/)
  and discuss it there.

- the docs are not uptodate. If you find documentation errors then
  please send patches to fix them. Out of date documentation is one of
  the main things holding back a Samba 2.0 release.

Major changes in Samba 2.0
--------------------------

There have been several major changes in Samba for version 2.0. Here
are some of them:

1). autoconf
------------

You now configure Samba by running "./configure" then make. See
docs/UNIX_INSTALL.txt 

2) domain control
-----------------

Samba can now (mostly) act as a NT primary domain controller and
domain logon server. Unfortunately this is largely undocumented at the
moment, but to get you started you want smb.conf entries like this:

	domain controller = Yes
	domain logons = Yes
	preferred master = Yes
	domain master = Yes

[netlogon]
	path = /data/netlogon
	read only = No

further documentation on this still needs to be written :)

3) option defaults changed
--------------------------

several parameters have changed their default values. The most
important of these is that the default security mode is now user level
security rather than share level security.

4) web based GUI configuration
------------------------------

Samba now comes with SWAT, a web based GUI config system. See
swat/README for how to set it up.


There have been lots of other changes as well. We'll add them here as
we remember them :)
