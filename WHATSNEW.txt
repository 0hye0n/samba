          WHATS NEW IN Samba (The Next Generation) 0.12
          ============================================

This is an ALPHA release of Samba TNG, the UNIX based SMB/CIFS file,
print and login server for Windows systems.

This release is to enlist the help of people who are unable to use
cvs (http://samba.org/cvs.html) in a major development project to
integrate Samba into a Windows NT (tm) Domain environment - the
NT Domains for Unix project.

If you are running Windows 9x and do not forsee the need for or
need to use any Windows NT Workstations on your network in the near
future, you will not need Samba TNG or any of its functionality,
and your assistance is not being solicited in the development of
this project.

Major changes in Samba TNG
--------------------------

There are many major changes in Samba TNG.  Here are some of them:

=====================================================================

1). Windows NT (tm) Primary Domain Controller compatibility
-----------------------------------------------------------

Samba TNG can act as a Primary Domain Controller to Windows NT 3.5,
4.0 and 5.0 (in 4.0 backwards-compatible mode) Workstations.  Backup
Domain Controller and Inter-Domain Trust Relationships are at an
early, but functional and very hands-on, stage.

2). Support for Windows NT (tm) Administrative tools
----------------------------------------------------

Significant in-roads have been made into providing support for at least
the following Windows NT (tm) tools and services:

- User Manager for Domains
- Server Manager for Domains
- Event Log
- Service Control Manager
- Registry Editor

A command-line tool named rpcclient, with a command-syntax similar to
smbclient, has over sixty five commands that provide equivalent
functionality for the same Windows NT (tm) Administrative tools,
including the ability to remotely shut down a Windows NT (tm) Server.

rpcclient has now been joined by net, samedit, regedit, spoolss,
eventlog, lsa, cmdat and svccontrol.  If anyone can think of better
names for these, suggestions are welcomed.

3). Portability
---------------

Samba is now self-configuring using GNU autoconf and libtool, removing
the need for people installing Samba to have to hand configure
Makefiles, as was needed in previous versions.

You now configure Samba by running "./configure" then "make".  See
docs/textdocs/UNIX_INSTALL.txt for details.

The use of libtool dramatically reduces the size of samba binaries.
As we are using libtool in a slightly different way from usual,
you may encounter run-time or compilation errors, so please repoty
them to us.

4). New SAM Database Daemons
----------------------------

The SAM database daemon, samrd, is being considered "legacy", and
the aim is to replace it.  To this end, some new SAM database
daemons are being developed - samrtdbd and samrnt5ldapd.
They need to be run with their counterparts, netlogontdbd or
netlogonnt5ldapd.  None of these are build as part of the standard
make, they have to be explicitly built because they are in
development.


=====================================================================

NOTE - Some important information
---------------------------------------

Samba TNG up to alpha-0.3 required that the samba server be joined
to its own Domain.  This requirement has been removed.

It is important that you read the source/README file for
instructions, and it is recommended that you join samba-ntdom@samba.org
for update information and status reports.  For details, please see:

http://samba.org/listproc/samba-ntdom

=====================================================================

NOTE - Primary Domain Controller Functionality
----------------------------------------------

This version of Samba contains code that correctly implements
the undocumented Primary Domain Controller authentication
protocols.  However, there is much more to being a Primary
Domain Controller than serving Windows NT logon requests.

A useful version of a Primary Domain Controller contains
many remote procedure calls to do things like enumerate users, 
groups, and security information, 98% of which Samba TNG currently
implements.  

This work is being done in the CVS (developer) versions of Samba,
development of which continues at a fast pace.  If you are
interested in participating in or helping with this development
please join the Samba-NTDOM mailing list.  Details on joining
are available at :

http://samba.org/listproc/

Details on obtaining CVS (developer) versions of Samba
are available at:

For this version, use a tag of SAMBA_TNG


=====================================================================

NOTE - Known Bugs
-----------------

It is *not* recommended that this version of Samba be run in a
production environment, for at least the following reasons:

1) nmbd is known to fork() every 20 minutes, resulting in an extra
process that hangs around.  It has also been reported, in a large
network neighbourhood environment with "wins support = no"
and "wins server = x.x.x.x" to flood the WINS server with about
3 requests per second to resolve every single name in the
network neighbourhood.  Be Warned!

This issue appears to have been resolved, cause unknown, fix unknown.

You can avoid this by using a stable, production release of nmbd, such
as can be found in 2.0.6a or later.

2) The new MSRPC architecture forks() one MSRPC daemon per incoming
service request.  The msrpc daemon stays around for as long as
the remote server maintains a connection to it.  An investigation
is underway to attempt to minimise the number of outstanding
connections, because a *single* NT user logon can result in up to
5 or 6 msrpc daemons waiting around, doing nothing but take up
process table space.

Connection reuse has now been added and debugged: the number of
incoming connections is reduced but still fairly large.


3) The Samba TNG code base was cut from the 2.0 development tree
approximately eighteen months ago.  That means that it does not have
any of the file and print server improvements or bug-fixes since
that time.  The use of Samba TNG as a file and print server is
therefore not recommended, and can be avoided by setting user
profiles and home directories to be on another Windows NT (tm) or
compatible file server.

As always, all bugs are our responsibility.
