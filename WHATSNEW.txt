purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.10 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

GPO Improvements
----------------

A new 'samba-tool gpo export' command has been added that can export a
set of Group Policy Objects from a domain in a generalised XML format.

A corresponding 'samba-tool gpo restore' command has been added to
rebuild the Group Policy Objects from the XML after generalization.
(The administrator needs to correct the values of XML entities between
the backup and restore to account for the change in domain).

kdc prefork
-----------

The KDC now supports the pre-fork process model and worker processes will be
forked for the KDC when the pre-fork process model is selected for samba.

prefork 'prefork children'
--------------------------

The default value for this smdb.conf parameter has been increased from 1 to
4.

netlogon prefork
----------------

DCERPC now supports pre-forked NETLOGON processes. The netlogon processes are
pre-forked when the prefork process model is selected for samba.

Offline domain backups
----------------------

The 'samba-tool domain backup' command has been extended with a new 'offline'
option. This safely creates a backup of the local DC's database directly from
disk. The main benefits of an offline backup are it's quicker, it stores more
database details (for forensic purposes), and the samba process does not have
to be running when the backup is made. Refer to the samba-tool help for more
details on using this command.

Group membership statistics
---------------------------

A new 'samba-tool group stats' command has been added. This provides summary
information about how the users are spread across groups in your domain.
The 'samba-tool group list --verbose' command has also been updated to include
the number of users in each group.

prefork process restart
-----------------------

The pre-fork process model now restarts failed processes. The delay between
restart attempts is controlled by the "prefork backoff increment" (default = 10)
and "prefork maximum backoff" (default = 120) smbd.conf parameters.  A linear
back off strategy is used with "prefork backoff increment" added to the
delay between restart attempts up until it reaches "prefork maximum backoff".

Using the default sequence the restart delays (in seconds) are:
  0, 10, 20, ..., 120, 120, ...

standard process model
----------------------

When using the standard process model samba forks a new process to handle ldap
and netlogon connections.  Samba now honours the 'max smbd processes' smb.conf
parameter.  The default value of 0, indicates there is no limit.  The limit
is applied individually to netlogon and ldap.  When the process limit is
exceeded Samba drops new connections immediately.

REMOVED FEATURES
================

MIT Kerberos build of the AD DC
-------------------------------

While not removed, the MIT Kerberos build of the Samba AD DC is still
considered experimental.  Because Samba will not issue security
patches for this configuration, such builds now require the explicit
configure option: --with-experimental-mit-ad-dc

For further details see
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Running_a_Samba_AD_DC_with_MIT_Kerberos_KDC

samba_backup
------------

The samba_backup script has been removed. This has now been replaced by the
'samba-tool domain backup offline' command.

smb.conf changes
================

  Parameter Name                     Description                Default
  --------------                     -----------                -------
  prefork backoff increment   Delay added to process restart    10 (seconds)
                              between attempts.
  prefork maximum backoff     Maximum delay for process between 120 (seconds)
                              process restart attempts
  smbd search ask sharemode   Name changed, old name was
                              "smbd:search ask sharemode"
  smbd async dosmode          Name changed, old name was
                              "smbd:async dosmode"
  smbd max async dosmode      Name changed, old name was
                              "smbd:max async dosmode"
  smbd getinfo ask sharemode  New: similar to "smbd search ask  yes
                              sharemode" but for SMB getinfo
