Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first preview release of Samba 4.6.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.6 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========

vfs_fruit option "fruit:resource" spelling correction
-----------------------------------------------------

Due to a spelling error in the vfs_fruit option parsing for the "fruit:resource"
option, users who have set this option in their smb.conf were still using the
default setting "fruit:resource = file" as the parser was looking for the string
"fruit:ressource" (two "s").

After upgrading to this Samba version 4.6, you MUST either remove the option
from your smb.conf or set it to the default "fruit:resource = file", otherwise
your macOS clients will not be able to access the resource fork data.

This version Samba 4.6 accepts both the correct and incorrect spelling, but the
next Samba version 4.7 will not accept the wrong spelling.

Users who were using the wrong spelling "ressource" with two "s" can keep the
setting, but are advised to switch to the correct spelling.

NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

kerberos client encryption types
--------------------------------
Some parts of Samba (most notably winbindd) perform Kerberos client
operations based on a Samba-generated krb5.conf file. A new
parameter, "kerberos encryption types" allows configuring the
encryption types set in this file, thereby allowing the user to
enforce strong or legacy encryption in Kerberos exchanges.

The default value of "all" is compatible with previous behavior, allowing
all encryption algorithms to be negotiated. Setting the parameter to "strong"
only allows AES-based algorithms to be negotiated. Setting the parameter to
"legacy" allows only RC4-HMAC-MD5 - the legacy algorithm for Active Directory.
This can solves some corner cases of mixed environments with Server 2003R2 and
newer DCs.


new option for owner inheritance
--------------------------------
The "inherit owner" smb.conf parameter instructs smbd to set the
owner of files to be the same as the parent directory's owner.
Up until now, this parameter could be set to "yes" or "no".
A new option, "unix only", enables this feature only for the UNIX owner
of the file, not affecting the SID owner in the Windows NT ACL of the
file. This can be used to emulate something very similar to folder quotas.
