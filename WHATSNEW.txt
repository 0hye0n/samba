Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.14.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.13 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================


CTDB CHANGES
============

* The NAT gateway and LVS features now uses the term "leader" to refer
  to the main node in a group through which traffic is routed and
  "follower" for other members of a group.  The command for
  determining the leader has changed to "ctdb natgw leader" (from
  "ctdb natgw master").  The configuration keyword for indicating that
  a node can not be the leader of a group has changed to
  "follower-only" (from "slave-only").  Identical changes were made
  for LVS.

* Remove "ctdb isnotrecmaster" command.  It isn't used by CTDB's
  scripts and can be checked by users with "ctdb pnn" and "ctdb
  recmaster".


NT4-like 'classic' Samba domain controllers
-------------------------------------------

Samba 4.13 deprecates Samba's original domain controller mode.

Sites using Samba as a Domain Controller should upgrade from the
NT4-like 'classic' Domain Controller to a Samba Active Directory DC
to ensure full operation with modern windows clients.

SMBv1 only protocol options deprecated
--------------------------------------

A number of smb.conf parameters for less-secure authentication methods
which are only possible over SMBv1 are deprecated in this release.

REMOVED FEATURES
================

The deprecated "ldap ssl ads" smb.conf option has been removed.
