continued to evolve, but you may particularly notice these areas:

  works, supporting most operations.  

  Winbind:  Kai Blin has been working hard on his Google Summer of
  Code project, creating a winbind implementation for Samba4.

  Heimdal update:  A Heimdal 1.0 snapshot is now included as the
  internal Kerberos library in Samba4.

  In the past few weeks, many small but significant bugs have been
  fixed, particularly thanks to Matthias Dieter Walln√∂fer <mwallnoefer@yahoo.de>

These are just some of the highlights of the work done in the past few
months.  More details can be found in our SVN history.
