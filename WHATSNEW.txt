Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.14.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.13 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================


The "ldap ssl ads" option no longer depends on "ldap ssl" option:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
With this release, the "ldap ssl ads" can be set to "yes" even if "ldap ssl"
is off.

The "ldap ssl ads" no longer requires sasl-wrapping to be set to plain:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is now done implicitly when over TLS, so "client ldap sasl wrapping"
does not need to be set to "plain" in order for it to work.
