              WHATS NEW IN 1.9.17alpha4 - July 3rd 1997.
              ==========================================

Improved browsing support. 
--------------------------

Samba now should support propagation of browse lists 
across subnets correctly. Look in the file docs/BROWSING.txt 
as it has been largely re-written to explain how to do this.

*IMPORTANT* All Samba servers acting as local/domain master
browsers must be running 1.9.17alpha3 (or later).

Samba 1.9.17alpha4 should now keep global and authoritative
browse lists separate - see docs/BROWSING.txt for full details.

Thanks to Silicon Graphics for allowing us to test the new 
code on their corporate network.


Improved share mode handling
----------------------------

The handling of share modes has been completely rewritten.
Samba can now run agressive PC Benchmarks (Ziff-Davis
NetBench) correctly with many hundreds of concurrent PC's.
The confidence level on share mode handling in Samba
is now much higher than it was previously. PC database
packages should be much safer when run against a
Samba share. Thanks to Silicon Graphics for testing
this code for us.

If at all possible compile Samba to use the new share
mode handling with shared memory (set the flags 
FAST_SHARE_MODES in the Makefile). This will be *much* faster
than old file-based share modes. FAST_SHARE_MODES have
been turned on by default on the following platforms in
the Makefile :

	Linux
	Solaris
	BSDI
	IRIX 5.x.x
	FreeBSD

A crash bug with slow share modes in 1.9.17alpha3 has been
corrected.

Updated smb.conf documentation
------------------------------
All options are now documented we believe.

Many bugfixes and improvements
------------------------------
From around the 'net around the world. Many
thanks to everyone who contributed.

A list of the new code since alpha3 includes :

*** Fix for roaming profiles hanging on a Samba drive.
*** smbclient can now query Win95/NT print queues.
*** smbd can now rename across filesystem mount points.
*** New 'force xxx mode' options allow more control over
    Unix file permissions.
*** New 'client code page' option for internationalization
    support.
*** Documentation update.

Remaining known issues with cross-subnet browsing.
--------------------------------------------------
When nmbd is acting as a WINS server it doesn't handle
de-registering of members of a WORKGROUP<1e> name correctly.
The first machine to de-register will remove the name. This
should be fixed in a later release when group names are 
handled correctly in the WINS code.

Remember - this is new code so there may be
bugs or problems.

As always, all bugs are our responsibility -
