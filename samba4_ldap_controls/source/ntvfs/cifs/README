This is the 'CIFS on CIFS' backend for Samba. It provides a NTVFS
backend that talks to a remote CIFS server. The primary aim of this
backend is for debugging and development, although some poeple may
find it useful as a CIFS gateway.


Here is a typical config:

[myshare]
	ntvfs handler = cifs
	cifs:server = myserver
	cifs:user = tridge
	cifs:password = mypass
	cifs:domain = TESTDOM
	cifs:share = test
