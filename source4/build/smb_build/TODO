- hack for loading modules locally
 - create 
- saner names for some of the .pc files
- .pc files also when there is a public header?
- get rid of include/structs.h and include/proto.h
 - support including a custom header by librpc/gen_ndr/*.c files
- plugin loading support in ldb
- add register function to smbtorture
- proper #include dependencies:
  for each subsystem:
  - include line in Makefile
  - rule in Makefile
- determine dependencies from #include lines ?
- install (parts of ?) autogenerated headers
