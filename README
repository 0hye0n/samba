This is version 1.9 of Samba, the free SMB client and server for unix.

>>>> Please read THE WHOLE of this file as it gives important information

This software is freely distributable under the GNU public license, a
copy of which you should have received with this software (in a file
called COPYING). 

WHAT CAN SAMBA DO?
==================

Here is a very short list of what samba includes, and what it does

- a SMB server, to provide LanManager style file and print services to PCs

- a Netbios (rfc1001/1002) nameserver

- a ftp-like SMB client so you can access PC resources (disks and
printers) from unix

- a tar extension to the client for backing up PCs

Related packages include:

- ksmbfs, a linux-only filesystem allowing you to mount remote SMB
filesystems from PCs on your linux box

- tcpdump-smb, a extension to tcpdump to allow you to investigate SMB
networking problems over netbeui and tcp/ip


CONTRIBUTIONS
=============

If you want to contribute to the development of the software then
please join the mailing list. I accept patches (preferably in 
"diff -u" format) and am always glad to receive feedback or suggestions.

You could also send hardware/software/money/jewelry or pizza
vouchers directly to me. The pizza vouchers would be especially
welcome :-)

If you like a particular feature then look through the change-log and
see who added it, then send them an email.

Remember that free software of this kind lives or dies by the response
we get. If noone tells us they like it then we'll probably move onto
something else.
