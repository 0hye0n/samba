This is version 1.9 of Samba, the free SMB client and server for unix.

This software is freely distributable under the GNU public license, a
copy of which you should have received with this software (in a file
called COPYING). 

WHAT CAN SAMBA DO?
==================

Here is a very short list of what samba includes, and what it does. 

- a SMB server, to provide Windows NT and LAN Manager-style file and print 
  services to SMB clients such as Windows 95, Warp Server, smbfs and others.

- a Netbios (rfc1001/1002) nameserver, which among other things gives 
  browsing support. Samba can be the master browser on your LAN if you wish.

- a ftp-like SMB client so you can access PC resources (disks and
printers) from unix, Netware and other operating systems

- a tar extension to the client for backing up PCs

For a much better overview have a look at the web site at
http://samba.canberra.edu.au/pub/samba, and browse the user survey.

Related packages include:

- smbfs, a linux-only filesystem allowing you to mount remote SMB
filesystems from PCs on your linux box. This is included as standard with
Linux 2.0 and later.

- tcpdump-smb, a extension to tcpdump to allow you to investigate SMB
networking problems over netbeui and tcp/ip


CONTRIBUTIONS
=============

If you want to contribute to the development of the software then
please join the mailing list. I accept patches (preferably in 
"diff -u" format, see docs/BUGS.txt for more details) and am always glad to 
receive feedback or suggestions.

You could also send hardware/software/money/jewelry or pizza
vouchers directly to me. The pizza vouchers would be especially
welcome :-)

If you like a particular feature then look through the change-log and
see who added it, then send them an email.

Remember that free software of this kind lives or dies by the response
we get. If noone tells us they like it then we'll probably move onto
something else. However, as you can see from the user survey quite a lot of 
people do seem to like it at the moment :-)

You might also like to look at the usenet news group
comp.protocols.smb as it often contains lots of useful info and is
frequented by lots of Samba users. The newsgroup was initially setup
by people on the Samba mailing list. It is not, however, exclusive to
Samba, it is a forum for discussing the SMB protocol (which Samba
implements).
