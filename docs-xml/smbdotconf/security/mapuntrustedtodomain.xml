    <para>
    By default, and with <smbconfoption name="map untrusted to domain">no</smbconfoption>,
    if a client connects to smbd using an untrusted domain name, such as
    BOGUS\user, smbd replaces the BOGUS domain with it's SAM name
    (forcing local authentication) before
    attempting to authenticate that user.  In the case where smbd is acting as
    a NT4 PDC/BDC this will be DOMAIN\user.  In the case where smbd is acting as a
    domain member server or a standalone server this will be WORKSTATION\user.
    </para>

    <para>
    With <smbconfoption name="map untrusted to domain">yes</smbconfoption>,
    smbd provides the legacy behavior matching that of versions of Samba pre 3.4:
    the BOGUS domain name would always be replaced by the
    primary domain before attempting to authenticate that user.
    This will be DOMAIN\user in all server roles except active directory domain controller.
