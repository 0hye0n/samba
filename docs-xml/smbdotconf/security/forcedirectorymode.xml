    <para>This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit 
    permissions that will <emphasis>always</emphasis> be set on a directory 
    created by Samba. This is done by bitwise 'OR'ing these bits onto the 
    mode bits of a directory that is being created. The default for this 
    parameter is (in octal) 0000 which will not add any extra permission 
    bits to a created directory. This operation is done after the mode 
    mask in the parameter <parameter moreinfo="none">directory mask</parameter> is 
    applied.</para>

    <para>
    New in Samba 4.0.0. This mode is also 'OR'ed into the mode bits whenever
    permissions are changed on a directory, not just when the file is created.
    This replaces the now removed <parameter moreinfo="none">force directory security mode</parameter>.
    </para>

	<para>The example below would force all created directories to have read and execute
    permissions set for 'group' and 'other' as well as the
    read/write/execute bits set for the 'user'.</para>
