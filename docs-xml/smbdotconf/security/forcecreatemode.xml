    <para>This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit
    permissions that will <emphasis>always</emphasis> be set on a
    file created by Samba. This is done by bitwise 'OR'ing these bits onto
    the mode bits of a file that is being created. The default for this parameter is (in octal)
    000. The modes in this parameter are bitwise 'OR'ed onto the file
    mode after the mask set in the <parameter moreinfo="none">create mask</parameter>
    parameter is applied.</para>

    <para>
    New in Samba 4.0.0. This mode is also 'OR'ed into the mode bits whenever
    permissions are changed on a file, not just when the file is created.
    This replaces the now removed <parameter moreinfo="none">force security mode</parameter>.
    </para>

    <para>The example below would force all newly created files to have read and execute
    permissions set for 'group' and 'other' as well as the
    read/write/execute bits set for the 'user'.</para>
