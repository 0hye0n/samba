	<para>
	If this parameter is set Samba attempts to store a create timestamp on any file or directory created by Samba
	in a filesystem extended attribute. The data is written as an 8 byte Windows timestamp in little-endian form
	in attribute named "user.DosTimestamps". This extended attribute is explicitly hidden from smbd clients requesting an
	EA list. On Linux the filesystem must have been mounted with the mount option user_xattr in order for
	extended attributes to work, also extended attributes must be compiled into the Linux kernel.
