This is a prelodable shared library that provides SMB client services
for existing executables. Using this you can simulate a smb
filesystem.

Currently this code only works on Linux with glibc2. Eventually I hope
to make it portable to lots of OSes but at the moment if you don't
have Linux then don't even try to use it.

To use it you need to do this:

export SMBW_USER=username
export SMBW_PASSWORD=username
export LD_PRELOAD=full_path_to_smbwrapper.so

then try to access /smb/SERVER/SHARE/ and see what happens.

For debugging you can set SMBW_DEBUG to an integer debug level.

This is code under development. Lots of things don't work yet. Quite a
few things do though, for example I've successfully run tar, less, ls,
bash, cmp, cat, du and a bunch of other utilities on files accessed
via this library.

If you want to help with the development of this code then join the
samba-technical mailing list.
