# This script generates a list of testsuites that should be run as part of 
# the Samba 3 test suite.

# The output of this script is parsed by selftest.pl, which then decides 
# which of the tests to actually run. It will, for example, skip all tests 
# listed in selftest/skip or only run a subset during "make quicktest".

# The idea is that this script outputs all of the tests of Samba 3, not 
# just those that are known to pass, and list those that should be skipped 
# or are known to fail in selftest/skip or selftest/samba4-knownfail. This makes it 
# very easy to see what functionality is still missing in Samba 3 and makes 
# it possible to run the testsuite against other servers, such as Samba 4 or 
# Windows that have a different set of features.

# The syntax for a testsuite is "-- TEST --" on a single line, followed 
# by the name of the test, the environment it needs and the command to run, all 
# three separated by newlines. All other lines in the output are considered 
# comments.
