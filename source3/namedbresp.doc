module namedbresp deals with the maintenance of the list of expected
responses - creating, finding and removal.

module nameresp deals with the initial transmission, re-transmission
and time-out of netbios response records.


/*************************************************************************
  find_response_record()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for matching the unique response transaction
id with an expected response record. as a side-effect of this search,
it will find the subnet (or the WINS pseudo-subnet) that samba expected
the response to come from.


/*************************************************************************
  make_response_queue_record()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for creating a response record, which will
be queued awaiting a response.

the number of retries is set to 4, and the retry period set to 1 second.
if no response is received, then the packet is re-transmitted, which is
why so much information is stored in the response record.

the number of expected responses queued is kept, so listen_for_packets()
knows it must time-out after 1 second if one or more responses are
expected.


/*************************************************************************
  remove_response_record()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for removing a response record from the
expected response queue. the number of expected responses is decreased.


/*************************************************************************
  add_response_record()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for adding the response record created by
make_response_queue_record() into the appropriate response record queue.
