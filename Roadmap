The Samba-Team are committed to an agressive program to deliver quailty
controlled software to a well defined roadmap.

The current Samba release 1.9.17 is called the "Browse Fix Release"
The following development objectives are in place:

Version	/ Codename	Notes
------------------	----------------------------------------------------
1.9.18 			This version will feature two main areas of improvement
"Perf-Lock Release"	- introduction of OpLock support
			- introduction of new browse list and WINS methods

1.9.19			An authentication update release to offer improved
"Auth Code Release"	security and password synchronisation capabilities

1.9.20			Introduction of new managment tools
"GUI Config Release"

2.0			The next generation Directory Services update
"DSA Release"

While no release date or content promises are made we are hoping to release
the remainder of the 1.9 series relases within a 4 (four) month period,
ie: before end of calender year 1997.

Should a budding contributor spring into gear and deliver any of the above
ahead of the above release sequence then we reserve the option to make an
out of sequence release (but always keeping to a logical sequence code number).
