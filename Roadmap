The Samba-Team are committed to an aggressive program to deliver quality
controlled software to a well defined roadmap.

Please also look at the Samba3 and Samba4 pages of wiki.samba.org for more
information.

The following development objectives for future releases
are in progress:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samba-3.0.x		This release turned into maintenance mode since we
			released 3.2.

Samba-3.6.x		This is the current stable Samba 3 release intended
			for all Samba production server.

Samba-4.0		A future release including the AD domain controller
                        feature, and the file server and other functionality 
                        from Samba 3.6.


Note that it is a given that the Samba-Team will continue to track
Windows releases, ensuring that Samba will work
well with whatever releases Redmond throws our way :-).
