The Samba-Team are committed to an agressive program to deliver quailty
controlled software to a well defined roadmap.

The current Samba release 1.9.17 is called the "Browse Fix Release"
The following development objectives are in place:

Version	/ Codename	Notes
------------------	----------------------------------------------------
1.9.18 			This version will feature three main areas of improvement
"Perf-Lock Release"	- introduction of OpLock support
			- introduction of new browse list and WINS methods
			- full support for multi-homed servers

1.9.19			An authentication update release to offer improved
"Auth Code Release"	security and password synchronisation capabilities
			- watch out for new Windows NT interoperability
			  features.

1.9.20			Introduction of new managment tools
"GUI Config Release"	Improved multi-language support.
			- GUI Configuration Manager (Web based)

2.0			The next generation Directory Services update
"DSA Release"		(We are still working on the features list)

While no release date or content promises are made we are hoping to release
the remainder of the 1.9 series relases within short time frame.

Should a budding contributor spring into gear and deliver any of the above
ahead of the above release sequence then we reserve the option to make an
out of sequence release (but always keeping to a logical sequence code number).
