<h1>Installation</h1>

Welcome to Samba4 installation. Before proceeding, you will need to
know:

<ul>
<li>The domain name you will use
<li>The realm name you will use
</ul>

After you have decided on those, choose the 'Provisioning' menu item
on the left, and fill in the form.<p>

<b>Warning!</b> When you provision, your existing user database is
wiped and replaced with a new one.
