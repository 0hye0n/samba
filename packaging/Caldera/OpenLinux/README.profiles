This directory is used to store the roaming Profiles of your Windows
users. For more information install the package samba-doc and read
file /usr/share/doc/samba-2.0.7/docs/textdocs/DOMAIN.txt

The default configuration opens the access rights for read/write for
anyone. If you see a problem in it, disable the Profiles support in
your samba configuration: either edit file /etc/samba.d/smb.conf or
use swat ( http://localhost:901/ ).
