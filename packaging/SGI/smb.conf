; Configuration file for smbd.
; ============================================================================
; For the format of this file and comprehensive descriptions of all the
; configuration option, please refer to the man page for smb.conf(5).

; This is a sample configuration for IRIX 6.x systems
;
; The following configuration should suit most systems for basic usage and 
; initial testing. It gives all clients access to their home directories and
; allows access to all printers specified in /etc/printcap as well as /usr/tmp.
;
[global]
   comment = Samba %v
   workgroup = workgroup
   printing = sysv
;
; A printcap file is created during installation that contains the names
; of all printers attached to your system. Names longer than 8 characters
; will not be visible to clients.
;
   printcap name = /usr/samba/printcap
;
; If you are using Impressario then you'll want to use the
; sambalp script provided with this package.  It works around
; a problem in the PostScript generated by the standard Windows
; drivers--there is a check to verify sufficient virtual memory
; is available in the printer to print the job, but this fails
; under Impressario because of a bug in Impressario.  The sambalp
; script strips out the vmstatus check.  BTW, when using this
; setup to print be sure to configure a Windows printer driver
; that generates PostScript--QMS-PS 810 is one that should work
; with the sambalp script.
;
