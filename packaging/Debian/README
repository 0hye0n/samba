Building Samba Packages for Debian GNU/Linux
--------------------------------------------

If you want to build Samba packages for Debian and you just want to use
upstream sources, i.e. no patches from the official Samba Debian packages,
follow these instructions:

1) cd samba[-<version>]
2) ln -s packaging/Debian/<dist> debian
3) dch -i
     - Edit the changelog and make sure the version is right. For example,
	   for Samba 2.2.2, the version number should be 2.2.2-0.1 (use
	   a number less than 1 like 0.1, 0.2, etc. so there is no conflict
	   with future upgrades to the official Debian packages.)
4) debian/rules binary
5) That's it. Your new packages should be in ../. Install with dpkg.
