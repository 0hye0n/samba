Subject: Encrypted password support
-----------------------------------

Encrypted passwords applies to the SMB connections serviced by this
machine, not to local user logons. Local user logons are services by
the security system chosen by your system administrator.

To enable SMB encrypted password support do the following:

1) Put /usr/local/samba/bin in your PATH
2) Edit /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf and uncomment the
	line "encrypt passwd = yes"
3) Execute: smbpasswd -a "username" "password"

The above will create your /usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd file
in which will be the NT and LanMAN hashed passwords.
