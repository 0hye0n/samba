Run the packaging.script file passing it the base directory (the root directory of the Samba distribution). This will create a package in the /tmp directory. 
CHECK that you've made the binaries before packaging.

By default, the package will be built to install samba in /usr/local
To change the default, modify the INSTALL_BASE variable in packaging.script.
This is after you have configured samba with a --prefix option of the alternate samba location and then created the binaries.

The static_prototype file contains the package information that is hardcoded.
The dyngen_prototype script generates package information based on the files present in that distribution (e.g. docs that are present, binaries etc) and appends it to the static_prototype file to form the package prototype file.
