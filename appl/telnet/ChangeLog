	* libtelnet/kerberos5.c: remove old garbage and fix call to
 	krb5_auth_con_setaddrs_from_fd

	* telnetd/telnetd.c: Output contents of /etc/issue.

	* telnet/telnet_locl.h: only include <sys/termio.h> iff
 	!defined(HAVE_TERMIOS_H)

	* libtelnet/kerberos.c (kerberos4_is): send the peer address to
 	krb_rd_req

	* telnetd/telnetd.c (terminaltypeok): always return OK.  It used
 	to call `tgetent' to figure if it was a defined terminal type.
  	It's possible to overflow tgetent so that's a bad idea.  The worst
 	that could happen by saying yes to all terminals is that the user
 	ends up with a terminal that has no definition on the local
 	system.  And besides, most telnet client has no support for
 	falling back to a different terminal type.

	* libtelnet/kerberos5.c: remove lots of old junk.  clean-up.
  	better error checking and reporting.  tell the user permission
 	denied much earlier.

	* libtelnet/kerberos.c (kerberos4_is): only print
 	UserNameRequested if != NULL
