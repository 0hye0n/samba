Samba4 developer howto
----------------------

tridge@samba.org, December 2004


This is a very basic document on how to setup a simple Samba4
server. This is aimed at developers who are already familiar with
Samba3 and wish to participate in Samba4 development. This is not
aimed at production use of Samba4.


Step 1: download Samba4
-----------------------

There are 2 methods of doing this:

  method 1:  "rsync -avz samba.org::ftp/unpacked/samba4 ."

  method 2:  "svn co svn://svnanon.samba.org/samba/branches/SAMBA_4_0 samba4"

both methods will create a directory called "samba4" in the current
directory. If you don't have rsync or svn then install one of them. 

Note that the above rsync command will give you a checked out svn
repository. So if you also have svn you can update it to the latest
version at some future date using:

  cd samba4
  svn up


Step 2: compile Samba4
----------------------

Run this:

  cd samba4/source
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure.developer -C
  make

If you have gcc 3.4 or newer, then run "make pch" before "make" to
greatly speed up the compile process (about 5x faster).


Step 3: install Samba4
----------------------

Run this as a user who have permission to write to the install
directory (defaults to /usr/local/samba). Use --prefix option to
configure above to change this.
 
  make install


Step 4: provision Samba4
------------------------

The "provision" step sets up a basic user database. 

  cd source
  ./script/provision.pl --realm=YOUR.REALM --domain=YOURDOM --adminpass=SOMEPASSWORD

This will create a file called newsam.ldb. You need to copy this to
sam.ldb in the "private" subdirectory of your install. For example:

  cp newsam.ldb /usr/local/samba/private/sam.ldb


Step 5: Create a simple smb.conf
--------------------------------

You need to create a smb.conf file in the lib/ directory of your
install. The default is /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf. A minimal
smb.conf would be:

  workgroup = YOURDOM

  [test]
	path = /data/test
	read only = no

The workgroup must exactly match the --domain argument you gave to provision.pl


Step 6: starting Samba4
-----------------------

The simplest is to just run "smbd", but as a developer you may find
the following more useful:

   smbd -i -M single -d3

that means "start smbd without messages in stdout, and running a
single process, with level 3 debugging". That mode of operation makes
debugging smbd with gdb particularly easy.

Make sure you put the bin and sbin directories from your new install
in your $PATH. Make sure you run the right version!


Step 7: testing Samba4
----------------------

try these commands:

      smbclient //localhost/test -Uadministrator%SOMEPASSWORD
    or
     ./script/tests/test_posix.sh //localhost/test administrator
    SOMEPASSWORD

Note that to pass all the tests you would need to be using a
filesystem with user_xattr support. On many Linux systems with an ext3
filesystem this means mounting with the "-o user_xattr"
option. Consult your filesystem and kernel docs for more details.
