This is a set of waf 'tools' to help make building the Samba
components easier, by having common functions in one place. This gives
us a more consistent build, and ensures that our project rules are
obeyed


TODO:
  - fix deps for --target
  - cache project rules calculation
  - make pidl rules depend on full pidl sources
  - make script rules depend on the scripts
