The Samba package you have just unpacked contains the following:

Directory	Notes:
=========	======
docs		(Samba Documentation):
--------------------------------------
	Note in particular two files - INSTALL.txt and DIAGNOSIS.txt
	You should also pay close attention to all the files with a
	.txt extension.

	Most problems can be solved by reference to the two files mentioned.


examples	(Example configuration files):
----------------------------------------------
	Please pay close attention to the reference smb.conf file
	smb.conf.default that has now been included as the master guide.

	Do read the smb.conf manual page in considering what settings are
	appropriate for your site.


packaging	(Only for those wishing to build binary distributions):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Currently support is included only for RedHat Linux. We hope that
	other Unix OS vendors will contribute their binary distribution
	packaging control files - and we hope to make their binary packages
	available on the master ftp site under:
		samba.anu.edu.au/pub/samba/Binary_Packages/"OS_Vendor"


source		(The official Samba source files - expect more of these!):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	To build your own binary files you will need a suitable ansi C
	compiler. Also, you must edit the enclosed "Makefile" as required
	for your operating system platform. Then just run:
		a) make
		b) make install
	then
		c) set up your configuration files.

	NOTE: OS Vendors who provide Samba binary packages will generally
	integrate all Samba files into their preferred directory locations.
	These may differ from the default location ALWAYS used by the Samba
	sources. Please be careful when upgrading a vendor provided binary
	distribution from files you have built yourself.
