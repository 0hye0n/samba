## List of current Samba Maintainers 
##

This file contains a list of developers responsible for 
portions of the Samba 3.0 code.  It also lists developers
responsible for 3rd party projects that work with Samba
(e.g. vfs modules).  Note that this list is for you benefit, 
but please do not abuse it by constantly emailing a stream 
of help questions to the maintainers.  Some are more open 
to direct communication than others and most struggle with 
enormous amounts of email every day.

If a feature or functionality is not listed here, it probably 
means that multiple people maintain that code.  In that case, 
the best location for help is the user community mailing list 
<samba@samba.org>.  Currently this list restricts posting to 
members only.  You can find out more about this and other lists
at https://lists.samba.org/.

All bug reports for code that is maintained *within* the 
Samba subversion tree should be filed at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.
