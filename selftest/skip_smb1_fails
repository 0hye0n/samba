# This file contains a list of regular expressions matching testsuites that
# should be skipped during "make test".
# These testsuites are failing with min protocol set to SMB2_02 indicating
# that these tests are SMB1 only or have some SMB1 dependency \(or fail\) for
# so other odd reason. We need to either
# a) remove the failing test
# b) port the failing test to SMB2
# c) fix the test
