# This file contains a list of regular expressions matching the names of
# tests that are flapping. In other words, they sometimes succeed and
# sometimes fail, depending on external factors.
#
# "make test" will not report failures or successes for tests listed here.
#
# DO NOT ADD TESTS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE ACTUALLY FLAPPING
#
# It is much better to add known failing tests to 'knownfail', so the
# test system can warn when they actually start passing.
