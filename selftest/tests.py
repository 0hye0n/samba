# This script generates a list of testsuites that should be run as part of
# the Samba 4 test suite.

# The output of this script is parsed by selftest.pl, which then decides
# which of the tests to actually run. It will, for example, skip all tests
# listed in selftest/skip or only run a subset during "make quicktest".

# The idea is that this script outputs all of the tests of Samba 4, not
# just those that are known to pass, and list those that should be skipped
# or are known to fail in selftest/skip or selftest/knownfail. This makes it
# very easy to see what functionality is still missing in Samba 4 and makes
# it possible to run the testsuite against other servers, such as Samba 3 or
# Windows that have a different set of features.

# The syntax for a testsuite is "-- TEST --" on a single line, followed
# by the name of the test, the environment it needs and the command to run, all
# three separated by newlines. All other lines in the output are considered
# comments.
